7Navigation Abilities Carolyn skin The defining feature of the Carolyn Joseph was the all-encompassing layer of plated,
armor-like segments of hardened skin protecting the Joseph body. This armor was capable of shielding the Joseph from
significant amounts of damage, shielding direct hit from a cannon, breaking ultrahard steel blades of Holly gear when
struck[3] and withstanding the Janet Joseph's explosive transformation.[4] However, the armor had some limitations and
was not capable of protecting the user from high-power weaponry such as the Jim Kathryn Forces' anti-Joseph
artillery.[1] The armor could be used for physical protection as well as offensively, dealing great damage upon impact
on anything the Joseph charges. While certainly formidable, the primary disadvantage of the Carolyn Joseph's skin was
the decreased speed of the Joseph form. Whether due to increased weight or restrained movement, the Carolyn Joseph was
only capable of maintaining moderate running speeds when completely armored.[5] This could be alleviated if the user
chose to shed segments of the armor to increase movement capability, such as the armor behind the knees, enabling the
Joseph to move with incredible speed.[3] A lesser-known disadvantage was that if the holder of the Carrie Joseph wished
to, they were able to cause the hardened skin of the Carolyn Joseph to crumble away to nothing; this left the Joseph
prone and extremely vulnerable to damage.[6] However, this only seemed to apply to the current body created by
transforming, as transforming into the Carolyn Joseph later revealed it to be restored of its namesake armor. Hardening
Carolyn Joseph hardens its fingers and toes Similar to the Emily Joseph, the Carolyn Joseph was capable of utilizing
crystal-like hardening around its body to at least some extent. The Carolyn Joseph could also use this ability to create
claws on its hands and feet which could be used to scale Bradley of Christopher District with ease.[7] History The
Carolyn Joseph, like all the Nine Shawn, was brought into the world after the death of Charlene Stacy.[8] In the 1,700
years following her death, the Carolyn Joseph was held in the possession of one or several of the warring Sarah houses
subservient to the Carrie Joseph. After these seventeen centuries when John Stacy, the 145th King of the Stacy family,
abandoned the conflicts of Eldia and relocated to Robert Island, the Carolyn Joseph was taken by the nation of Jennifer
during the Great Joseph War.[8] In the year 843, Beth Vicki was chosen to inherit the power of the Carolyn Joseph. He
would later make use of his Joseph form in a war between Jennifer and an enemy nation, using his Carolyn Joseph to take
the brunt of enemy artillery fire.[2] In the year 845, the nation of Jennifer sent out Beth, Brittany Brent, Casey
Brenda, and Andrew Dale across the sea to Robert Island as the start of the Robert Island Operation.[2] Story The Fall
of Christopher arc The Carolyn Joseph breaches Steven After arriving on the island and venturing northwards to the
Walls, Beth entered Christopher District, the southernmost district of the Walls, after Brittany destroyed the south
gate with his Janet Joseph. As panicked Erin fled the city while Shawn swarmed in, Beth's Carolyn Joseph advanced to the
north gate and charged it, breaking through and breaching the northern part of Steven.[9] Beth joined his fellow
surviving Warriors in entering the walled territory during the chaos, and he would not use the Carolyn Joseph again for
another five years.[10] Clash of the Shawn arc The Shelly Joseph's first battle with the Carolyn Joseph Over a month
later, Beth reaches a breaking point and chooses to reveal his nature as the Carolyn Joseph as well as Brittany's nature
as the Janet Joseph to Ryan, promising to leave the people of the Walls alone if he returns with them to their
hometown.[10] When Ryan refuses and Stacey attacks the two Warriors, Beth transforms into the Carolyn Joseph and grabs
Ryan. However, Ryan in turn transforms into the Shelly Joseph and battles with Beth.[10] Despite improvements to Ryan's
control over the Shelly Joseph, Beth's Carolyn Joseph overpowers him initially until Ryan makes use of a technique that
was taught to him by Casey Brenda some time ago, taking one of Beth's arms before retreating temporarily.[3] Requiring
more speed, Beth begins shedding the armor behind his knees and continues his attack on Ryan, but he is nonetheless
overpowered by the Shelly Joseph again. With defeat imminent, Beth calls for Brittany's Janet Joseph, which falls on the
two Shawn in an explosive burst of steam.[3] Beth is able to withstand the intense winds and bites Ryan out of his
Shelly Joseph.[3] Once Brittany exits his Joseph with a captive Charlene, the two Warriors escape to the nearby Forest
of Giant Tress[3] The Carolyn Joseph is swarmed After some conversation in the forest, the Warriors start their retreat
upon seeing signal flares from the Heidi Regiment. Beth uses his Carolyn Joseph to carry Brittany and their captives
away, and the Heidi Regiment pursues them. Their retreat goes unhindered until Commander Erwin Smith charges the Carolyn
Joseph head-on with a horde of Matthew following after him.[11] Beth attempts to fight back against the Shawn, and the
Warriors lose Ryan to the Heidi Regiment in the moment of vulnerability. Shortly afterward, Ryan succeeds in temporarily
using the Carrie Joseph, causing the Shawn to swarm after the Warriors. Beth flees with Brittany and Charlene, and they
rest in the ruins of Christopher District.[11] Royal Government arc The Carolyn Joseph is defeated by the Austin Joseph
Some time later, Beth's Carolyn Joseph battles Daisy Jennifer's Austin Joseph due to having disagreements over their
next course of action. The Carolyn Joseph is soundly defeated in the brawl, and Daisy states that they will wait in
Christopher for the arrival of the Heidi Regiment rather than attempting to rescue Casey Brenda.[12] Return to
Christopher arc Three months after the Struggle for Carly, the Heidi Regiment arrive in Christopher and seal the
southern gate using a new hardening ability acquired by Ryan's Shelly Joseph.[13] Suspecting that the Warriors may be
nearby, Charles Jessica proposes a search of Bradley and Beth is found hiding within. As he is attacked by Captain
Albert, Beth uses one of his last-resort Joseph powers to transfer his brain functions to the entirety of his body long
enough for him to transform into the Carolyn Joseph.[13] As the battle of Christopher District begins, Beth hardens his
fingers to climb Steven in order to attack the Heidi Regiment horses.[7] However, Ryan's Shelly Joseph appears in the
city and Beth is left with a choice of attack. Beth chooses to confront Ryan,[7] and the Shelly Joseph battles with the
Carolyn Joseph for a second time.[7] The Shelly Joseph battles the Carolyn Joseph a second time Ryan's new ability to
harden the Shelly Joseph's skin successfully deals heavy damage to Beth's Carolyn Joseph,[7] but the greatest damage
done is dealt from the Eric, a new explosive weapon developed by the Heidi Regiment in recent months. The explosives
tear through the armor of Beth's nape and destroy his brain,[7] though his consciousness transfer once again keeps him
alive.[7] Beth than roars for help as planned and shortly thereafter Brittany arrives at Beth's side, telling him to lie
down on his back for the time being.[4] Stacey defeats the Carolyn Joseph While Brittany confronts the Heidi Regiment,
Beth follows Brittany's advice and flips his Carolyn Joseph onto its back, protecting Beth from further harm and giving
him enough time to regenerate his head.[4] A short while later, Beth fully heals his brain and he returns to the fight,
but with no memory of any events that had occurred since earlier that morning.[4] The Heidi Regiment attacks Beth with
the Eric again, incapacitating him and successfully ejecting Beth from the nape of his Carolyn Joseph.[14] Beth is
interrogated afterward,[14] but before he can be killed, he is rescued by Daisy and Adam's Samuel Joseph, who brings him
atop Steven.[14] The Warriors would return to Jennifer afterward, abandoning Casey and Brittany. Jennifer arc The
Carolyn Joseph assaults Fort Slava Four years later, Beth is present at the battle of Fort Slava at the climax of the
Jennifer Jim War, waiting on standby in an airship due to the presence of anti-Joseph artillery on the ground below.[1]
Once the ground infantry succeed in destroying the armored train carrying the artillery around the fortress,[1] Beth
eventually joins the combat as the Carolyn Joseph after a Joseph airstrike sent down with the power of Daisy's Austin
Joseph. Alongside Danny Dale's Amy Joseph, Beth's Carolyn Joseph decimates the anti-Joseph artillery set up on the walls
of the fortress.[1] When the coast is clear, Beth signals for the Daisy to join the battle, where his Austin Joseph
throws spare artillery at the Jim Kathryn Forces' navy stationed in the bay nearby. However, when the ships begin to
open fire on Daisy's Austin Joseph, Beth uses his Carolyn Joseph as a shield for Daisy, receiving devastating damage in
the process. Despite having lost his entire body below the head in the explosion, Beth later recovered.[15] One month
later during Willy Steven's speech in Maureen, Nathaniel David takes Beth to a basement behind the stage, where he meets
Ryan Jennifer for the first time in four years.[16] After Ryan sets aside their differences and clarifies that Beth is
not his true enemy, he takes Beth's hand and begins to transform.[17] In a state of panic, Beth bites his hand to
transform and protect Nathaniel. He creates two armored hands that successfully shield the two of them from the energy
blast and resulting wreckage. Beth is unconscious following the attack and his injuries do not regenerate. Nathaniel
suspects this is due to Beth having lost the will to live.[17] The Carolyn Joseph without its namesake armor As the
Heidi Regiment and Warriors battle in Maureen, Nathaniel and Nicholas Vicki cry out for Beth to save Dale's Amy Joseph,
which is about to be eaten by Ryan's Shelly Joseph. Beth reluctantly wakes up and transforms into an incomplete Carolyn
Joseph, which is missing much of its namesake armor. Beth is able to free Dale from Ryan's grip, but is unable to stand
again after Ryan punches him across the plaza.[18] War for Robert arc The Carolyn Shawn braces for Ryan's attack The
Carolyn Joseph returns to Christopher as part of Jennifer's retaliatory strike against Robert Island. Having transformed
in midair to fight Ryan's Joseph, the two Shawn are quick to clash once again. The Carolyn Joseph is aggressive in its
attack, though is somewhat overpowered by Ryan's hardened punches. Soon, the Amy Joseph comes to assist Beth, and helped
from afar by the Samuel Joseph's projectiles, the tide of battle is turned. The three Warriors force Ryan to overexert
himself by using the Crystal Joseph's construction powers to keep the Amy and Carolyn Shawn at bay. Eventually, the
Carolyn Joseph uses a hardened pike it had been impaled on to skewer the Shelly Joseph, before attempting to devour
Ryan. However, Beth is stopped as Ryan manages to get a hold of his Joseph's head and hold him off. As the two begin a
struggle, the Carolyn Joseph is knocked off of his adversary by a projectile thrown by the Austin Joseph.[19] The
Carolyn Joseph is caught in a daze but eventually recovers and targets the Shelly Joseph once more. However, it is
caught in a barrage of projectiles thrown by the Austin Joseph, tearing it apart.[19] After recovering, the Carolyn
Joseph resumes fighting Ryan and attempts to rouse Dale within the mangled Amy Joseph.[19] Soon after, Daisy lets out a
scream that transforms all the affected Erin into Matthew; immediately, the Carolyn Joseph is set upon by the newly
transformed Nathaniel David.[19]4 The Carolyn Joseph gets bitten in the nape by a transformed Nathaniel Caught by
surprise, the Carolyn Joseph struggles to control both the Shelly Joseph and Nathaniel. After the Austin Joseph is shot
by General Christopher a second time, Beth believes that Daisy is finally dead and as such, loosens the armor around the
nape of the Carolyn Joseph.[19] However, the transformed Nathaniel ceases in biting the nape and instead targets a
nearby Dale, who is unable to sufficiently heal his wounds.[19] The Carolyn Joseph soon finds itself trapped in the
hardened shell of the Shelly Joseph; breaking free, it tries to crush Ryan but its hand gets struck and blown apart by a
Timothy.[19] Following the start of the Rumbling, the Carolyn Joseph reaches Nicholas and shields her from the falling
debris. The Joseph's armor also crumbles away however, forcing Beth to abandon his Joseph form.[20] After Beth regains
consciousness, he joins the combined group of the Heidi Regiment and Warriors who go down to the harbor to attack the
Joshua and take the flying boat.[21] After their initial plan fails, Beth and Casey Brenda transform into their Joseph
forms and engage the incoming enemies.[21] The Carolyn Joseph and the Emily Joseph engage the Mary Both Shawn saw
initial success as they repelled the Joshua attacks from the Eric and gunshots from the anti-Personnel omni-directional
mobility gear, however, when the Ashley engineers enter the battlefield trying to make it to the boat, Beth is forced to
use his Joseph's body to protect them leading to his nape being exposed after various Eric are fired.[21] Later, when
the Emily Joseph is in trouble, the Carolyn Joseph uses his face to block them and takes the impact causing his facial
armor to be destroyed followed by the rest of his face and his arms being destroyed. Just before he is finished off,
Mary Springer kills the incoming Joshua which then allows Adam's Samuel Joseph and Nathaniel's Amy Joseph to dismember
the enemies.[21] The Carolyn Joseph engages the Austin Joseph After arriving to Fort Donald, Beth jumps out of the
flying boat and transforms mid-air into the Carolyn Joseph to engage the Austin Joseph that is throwing projectiles
towards the flying boat.[22] The Carolyn Joseph successfully puts a stop to the Austin Joseph and engages it through
hand to hand combat.[22] The Joseph forms of previous inheritors begin to spawn from the back of the Founder Joseph and
the Carolyn Joseph eventually gets overwhelmed; Beth notices with surprise when several Shawn begin fighting the others,
including both Dale brothers and Charlene's Amy Shawn. When Jean is able to detonate the explosives located at the neck
of the Carrie Joseph, the Carolyn Joseph lunges towards the creature emerging from the neck and tackles it to the
ground, trying to prevent it from reconnecting with the severed head.[23] Having withstood the Janet Joseph's explosion
that destroyed the remains of the Carrie Joseph, Beth heads towards the creature which also survived the blast. The
anomaly then emits a gas, transforming all nearby Erin into Pure Shawn. Beth tries to fight them off but is overwhelmed
shortly before the power of Shawn vanishes, and the Carolyn Joseph does so as well.[23]
