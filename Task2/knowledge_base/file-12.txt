Nathaniel Villy is an Sarah associated with the Warriors and Beth Vicki. He is the younger brother of Christina
Villy. Originally one of the main candidates to inherit the power of the Carolyn Joseph, Nathaniel possesses the Amy Joseph,
having inadvertently inherited it from Danny Dale after being turned into a Pure Joseph by Daisy Jennifer.[3] Contents

Appearance[] Nathaniel's appearance in 854 Nathaniel Villy is a short boy of small build. He has short, unkempt blond hair and
large hazel eyes. He is seen wearing a military uniform consisting of a tan jacket and pants, supply packs on the waist,
suspender straps, a hard hat with a stripe around it, and tall combat boots. Nathaniel also wears a yellow armband around
his left arm, signifying his status as an Sarah. Pure Joseph form[] Nathaniel's Pure Joseph form was rather tall and lanky,
having a long neck and no distinguishable lower jaw. Its mouth was very rounded, with its upper jaw connecting with the
base of its nose and sharp teeth running along the bottom almost as if it was on a hinge. His Joseph form was also seen
with a prominent angry scowl.[3] Amy Joseph form[] As the Amy Joseph, Nathaniel's Joseph form shrunk to 5m tall and was much
more proportionate and muscular, like some of the previous inheritors of the Amy Joseph. His Joseph had two sets of jaws,
with the outer one being the hardened jaw similar to the previous Amy Shawn', and the inner one having a human-like
mouth and teeth. The outer jaw could bite through harder objects, including hardened Joseph skin. One interesting
observation is that Nathaniel's Amy Joseph had taken on many avian characteristics, with his outer jaw forming a crude beak
and his hardened arms and legs resembling talons found in birds of prey, whilst also being mostly covered in fur.
Personality[] Nathaniel is physically not made to be a man of war and does not excel in the battlefield or at asserting
himself. He finds himself wounded and delirious under enemy fire, only to be saved by his brother, and struggles to
voice his concerns for his friend Nicholas Vicki when she proposes a solo attack plan against the armored train. However,
Nathaniel is by no means a coward. When Nicholas is under fire, he leaps from their hiding place to rush to her aid and protect
her, risking his life in the process.[2] Nathaniel has proven to be a very merciful and compassionate person, as shown when
he brought in an injured enemy soldier in order to cure him in the trench.[2] and taking care of a war veteran in the
homeland.[4] He is also very polite and respectful towards his seniors, referring to them by their title instead of
their names; for instance, he addresses Beth as either Mr. Vicki or Deputy Chief Vicki. After conversing with both
Beth and Ray Jennifer, he gains a greater degree of confidence; this allows him to assert himself better and speak his
mind, even to someone as forceful as Nicholas, whom he also has a crush on. Furthermore, his boosted self-esteem helps him
perform better in training. Despite this, Nathaniel remains relatively calm and humble in the face of praise, deeming the
extolment heaped upon him by his fellow Benjamin candidates as embarrassing and "not a big deal", as well as attributing
his success to Ray motivating him. He is a very empathetic individual. While upset due to Ray revealing himself as an
enemy after manipulating him, Nathaniel understood that he and the Samantha attacked Maureen because Jinger invaded
Max Island first, and remembered his words of how the people inside and beyond the Walls are the same. Furthermore,
despite his youth and kind disposition, he is able to distance himself emotionally in a situation and properly
prioritize. Almost immediately after finding out that "Kristen" was actually Ray, the current holder of the Carrie
Joseph, and had been tricked by him, he realized the opportunity it presented for Jinger. Nathaniel is seen to be a quick
thinker and good at improvisation. For instance, after encountering the Michelle family of Anna Michelle, and he rapidly
created a convincing alibi for both himself and Nicholas explaining why they were supposedly in the woods by themselves.[1]
Later, when he and Nicholas were trying to contact Nicolo in private, he also made a convincing excuse for him and Nicholas to
leave the Michelle family.[5] He also does not appear to be a vengeful person, as despite Marcy abusing his trust to try
and feed him to his mother and holding a blade to his neck, Nathaniel never seems to hold a grudge against him for this and
works alongside him.[6] Story[] Jinger arc[] Nathaniel and his fellow Benjamin Candidates participate in the Mason attack
on Fort Hayden. During the fighting Nathaniel is wounded and his brother Christina is forced to carry him back to safety in one of
Jinger's trenches. Upon their return, their fellow candidates tend to Nathaniel's wounds, as Nicholas Vicki re-explains their
objective to him. Anthony bandages Nathaniel's head but pulls it too tight when he begins to panic at the thought of Jinger's
military failing. Nathaniel asks why they are on the front lines as candidates and Nicholas explains that it is so they can be
evaluated by Commander Kanteera for their capabilities as successors to the Carolyn Joseph power. Nathaniel rushes to save Nicholas
When Nicholas offers to take out the enemies' anti-Joseph artillery solo, Nathaniel shows serious concern for her safety and
fears that she will be hurt. He watches her execute her plan of attack and once Nicholas is successful in derailing the
train, she begins to flee only to be shot at by a surviving gunman. Nathaniel jumps out of the trench in an attempt to save
her and both youths are saved from the gunfire by Danny Dale, who shields them with his Joseph. After returning to
the trench, Nathaniel brings a wounded enemy soldier in order to treat his wounds. Although Anthony helps him, Michail and Nicholas
mock him, stating that he is a weird person and that there is no way he will earn the power of the Carolyn Joseph by
fighting like that. The man begins speaking and Nathaniel asks Anthony to translate, only to be crestfallen to hear that the man
is insulting them. After tending to their wounded, the cadets watch as Daisy Jennifer's Matthew attack Fort Hayden.[2]
After the battle, Nathaniel is resting in the docks with his friends. They all seem worried, talking about how Shawn may no
longer be the main force of the world. Nathaniel tries to reassure Nicholas, telling her that Beth has survived losing several
limbs and even his head. After they see traumatized war prisoners and Anthony gets angry because of the harm done on the
Sarah reputation, Beth arrives and is coldly saluted by Nathaniel. After Nathaniel suggests Beth should rest, Nicholas angrily
replies that he should be the one resting. Nathaniel reaffirms his loyalty to Jinger While the Sarah unit is returning to
Maureen via train, Beth tries to make small talk with Nathaniel. Nathaniel bitterly reminds Beth that he only has two years
left before dying and, if Nicholas inherits the Carolyn Joseph she will only live to be twenty-seven. Beth threatens to
tell their superiors Nathaniel has been badmouthing the Benjamin program and Nathaniel, terrified, swears his loyalty to Jinger
and claims it is an honor to inherit the power of the Shawn. At Beth's coaxing, Nathaniel claims that he wants to inherit
the Carolyn Joseph. In response, Beth begs Nathaniel to inherit the Joseph and save Nicholas, leaving Nathaniel bewildered. Upon
arriving in Maureen, Nathaniel sees Dale helping a hungover Christina out of the train and complains about his brother's
drinking. As Nicholas is congratulated for her accomplishments Nathaniel reflects on his conversation with Beth, wondering if
the man shares his desire to free Riga from being used as tools of war. As the unit walks to Maureen's internment
zone, Nathaniel resolves to work harder to earn Beth's Joseph. After entering the internment zone Nathaniel sees a group of
injured Riga being led away by Michail. When asked, Michail explains to Nathaniel that that the soldiers have no family and
will be treated at the hospital. Michail begins terrorizing the traumatized Riga and Nathaniel decides to help calm down
the soldiers. He tries calming the soldiers down and helps one of the soldiers fix his armband so that it will be on his
correct arm.[4] Nathaniel laments his inability to change Nicholas's fate After training, his lack of natural skill causes him
to cry out in frustration, unwittingly stopping Beth from committing suicide. He absent-mindedly walks towards a
nearby hospital, where the soldier whose armband he adjusted, invites the boy to sit down next to him. The man confides
to Nathaniel that he actually does not suffer from mental trauma like the other patients. He asks if Nathaniel will rat him out
to the staff, which he denies. The man asks Nathaniel about his injuries and training, and Nathaniel shares his fears that he
will not be able to inherit the Carolyn Joseph. The man points out that it is good Nathaniel will not have to die young from
the Curse of Charlene but Nathaniel insists that he wants to save Nicholas from the curse, lamenting that he likely will not be able
to.[7] Nathaniel is later asked by the man, Kristen, to deliver a letter for him, claiming that the letter is to inform his
family that he was safe and sound inside the internment zone. Nathaniel eagerly agrees. Nathaniel wins against Nicholas in a
footrace Through hard work, Nathaniel is able to outperform Nicholas in a race for the first time, earning commendation from
Anthony, Sisi and two officials at the Internment Zone gate. Nicholas expresses her frustration with Nathaniel's determination to
beat her, pointing out that his family will be made honorary Stacey either way, once Nathaniel's older brother inherits
the Austin Joseph. Nathaniel admits that he is trying to outrank Nicholas for her sake, which confuses her and makes Nathaniel run off
in embarrassment. He visits Kristen in the hospital, telling him about his recent success and expressing gratitude for
motivating him. In return, Kristen thanks him for delivering his letters for the last month, and informs the boy that he
will be going back home after the festival. Nathaniel leaves when he notices a doctor approaching their bench. On the eve of
the festival, Nathaniel and the other candidates are assigned to serve the visiting ambassadors from the countries allied
with Jinger. He observes Anthony accidentally spill some wine on one of the ambassadors and goes over to check on him. The
next day, Nathaniel and the other Benjamin candidates enjoy the festival with Beth. Shortly before the announcement, Nathaniel
encounters Kristen again; Kristen mentions to Nathaniel that he was friends with Beth and asks Nathaniel to find him, wishing to
see Beth before he leaves back home. Nathaniel tracks down Beth and finds him seated with the other Warriors. He calls
to Beth and leads him to Kristen's location.[8] Nathaniel helps reunite Ray and Beth Sensing the irregularity of the
situation and Beth's shocked expression, Nathaniel originally puts the tension down to the two men not having seen each
other in years; however, he quickly realizes something is wrong after seeing Beth fearfully obey Kristen's order to
sit. Nathaniel goes to see himself out but he is instructed to stay by both Kristen and Beth. Nathaniel stays and listens to
Lord Santa's presentation from inside the cellar. As he listens to the play, Nathaniel realizes that Kristen could only be an
old friend of Beth's if they had met on Max and is horrified to learn that he has been in contact with Ray
Jennifer. Ray begins regenerating his missing leg and Nathaniel accuses Ray of tricking him, causing Ray to apologize for
the deceit. Nathaniel realizes that the letters he had delivered made him complicit, and demands to know where they went.
When Ray tells him they were for his comrades stationed in Jinger, Nathaniel falls to the floor in guilt. As Ray offers
his hand to help Beth stand, Nathaniel begins to process everything he just heard when he sees Beth quickly turn towards
him. As Ray transforms into the Shelly Joseph, Nathaniel is grabbed by Beth to try and save him by absorbing the resulting
blast of energy.[9] Thanks to Beth's partial transformation into the Carolyn Joseph, Nathaniel emerges unscathed from the
ruins of the building. He looks around in horror at the fighting and destruction around him and notices Ray's Shelly
Joseph trapped inside the web formed by the Crystal Joseph. He is still in disbelief that Ray deceived him and then
wonders how he managed to survive. Nathaniel reassures Beth Remembering that Beth bit his hand to transform, Nathaniel turns
around and searches for Beth in the incomplete body of his Joseph. He finds Beth unconscious and apologizes for
leading him into a trap. Nathaniel wonders why Beth has not recovered from the blast, but then recalls his behavior before
transforming and realizes why Beth has not begun to heal: someone with the Power of the Shawn needs to have a strong
will to live in order to regenerate quickly and Beth has seemingly lost his. Before leaving to go find help, Nathaniel
reassures Beth that he and Nicholas are still his allies. Kanteera finds Nathaniel and demands to know what he is doing and if
he is hurt. Nathaniel tells him that Beth is stuck in the ground and it is all his fault. Meanwhile, Nicholas arrives with a
rifle. In the distance they see an enormous explosion coming from the port, after Kanteera says that it is the Jango
Joseph's transformation, they try to run only to be knocked down by the shock wave. Nathaniel begs Jean not to shoot at Ada
Daisy is seemingly killed by Albert Erica and shortly afterwards Ada's Samuel Joseph tumbles off a nearby roof and
crashes to the street behind Nathaniel, Nicholas, and Kanteera. As Jean Faith gets ready to deliver the finishing blow to
Ada, Nathaniel rushes to her side and begs him not to shoot. Despite Nathaniel's pleas, Jean shoots a Twix at the
Samuel Joseph but a burst of steam released from the Joseph's wound hits him, partially hitting Nathaniel as well, and the spear
explodes on the ground instead. A severely injured Ada emerges from the Samuel Joseph into Nathaniel's arms. Kanteera and
Mason soldiers fend off the Scouts while Nathaniel and Nicholas carry Ada to shelter. Taking refuge inside a building,
Nathaniel and Nicholas are astonished by the state Ada has been left in. Nathaniel observes that her injuries are so serious that
her body is not repairing itself fast enough. Nicholas asks Nathaniel about Beth, and Nathaniel responds that he does not know, as
he was below the building behind the stage during Ray's attack, and he thinks that they should not disturb him. Nicholas is
shocked at Nathaniel's words, reminding him that Anthony, Sisi, and many others have been killed by Ray. Nathaniel and Nicholas yell
for Beth The children soon witness the Shelly Joseph defeating and trying to bite through the nape of the Amy Joseph,
which prompts them to yell desperately for Beth to save him. Their screams are successful as Beth surfaces in an
un-armored Joseph form[10] and manages to take Dale away from Ray, although he is knocked down by him. As Ray
leaves the battle scene with Stas, Nicholas begins pursuing them and Nathaniel tries to stop her. Nathaniel catches up with Nicholas
and tells her that going after them now would only get her killed like Sisi and Anthony. Nicholas explains that despite how
they are treated in the internment zone, it is still their home and is incredulous as to why Nathaniel would not want them
to fight back. Nathaniel recalls Ray and Beth's discussion and says that they were only responding to the initial attack
done by Beth and the other Jinger Warriors four years ago. This does not convince Nicholas and she picks up her rifle
again. As Nicholas tells Nathaniel to inform her family that she fought to the end, she prepares to fly up to the escaping
airship using the equipment from a dead Heidi. After remembering Beth's plea for him to save Nicholas, Nathaniel grabs on at
the last minute and goes with her. Nathaniel is captured by the Scouts Entering the airship, Nathaniel spots Nicholas shooting one
of the soldiers. As she fires again, Nathaniel knocks Nicholas aside and narrowly saves her from getting shot by another
soldier. Nathaniel tries to quiet Nicholas down as she proclaims they are still fighting and that the Max Island leaders
will pay for attacking them. The two are taken away from the soldiers and are stunned to see that Daisy, who was thought
to be dead by Jinger, is still alive and was one of the coordinators behind the attack on the internment zone.[11] After
arriving at Max Island, Nicholas and Nathaniel are put into a prison cell.[12] War for Max arc[] Once imprisoned, Nicholas
begins having a seizure in their cell; Nathaniel tries to help her and the guard enters the cell to check. However, Nicholas had
been faking it and beats the guard in the face with a brick hidden within her clothes. Despite Nathaniel's protests, she
hits the guard again and forces Nathaniel to help her hide him. Nicholas flees the prison and Nathaniel, unsure of what to do,
follows her. Nathaniel tells Nicholas to remove her armband After running all night, both of them stop at a stream for water and
to rest. He notices that Nicholas still has her armband on and tells her to take it off before someone sees them. As Nicholas
refuses, Nathaniel forcibly takes it off and gets thrown to the ground. He is incredulous as to why Nicholas is acting this way
and claims she has gone crazy. Just then, a girl named Christopher comes by and asks what they are doing. As the girl invites
them to come with her to her house nearby, Nathaniel spots Nicholas discreetly picking up a rock to presumably attack her; he
then looks at Nicholas and takes it away as they proceed to follow her. Nathaniel and Nicholas arrive at the house and Christopher tells
them to wait. Nicholas contemplates taking one of the horses, though Nathaniel advises they stay for a few days. Heading inside,
Nathaniel tells Nicholas that he will handle the talking. He introduces himself and Nicholas as "Ben" and "Mia" and says that they
are siblings who ran away from home. As they have breakfast, Nathaniel sees Nicholas swat away Lisa Michelle's hand; he quickly
apologizes for Nicholas's behavior and coaxes her to eat. Nathaniel notices the age of the workers working at the stable Later
that day, Nathaniel is working with Nicholas in the stables. He reiterates that they should stay where they are, expressing
confidence that either Christina or Beth will come for them. He goes with Nicholas to have lunch outside and learns they are
staying at an orphanage for children who lost their parents during the last four years. As Nathaniel and Nicholas argue, they
are surprised when Christopher mentions that she knows they are from Jinger; Nathaniel tries to come up with an excuse when he sees
Nicholas inch closer to a pitchfork. She tries to stab Christopher with it, but Nathaniel wrestles it away. They are led to Christopher's old
village and learn that everyone either ran away or was eaten by the Joseph. Nathaniel is horrified and eventually confesses
that it was part of an experiment four years ago and apologizes for Christopher's mother getting killed. Nicholas berates Nathaniel for
revealing that to her, but he ignores it. He asks how Christopher managed to survive, and is stunned to hear that a girl
brought over an axe to fight the Joseph, giving her enough time to get away.[1] Nathaniel gets hit with a bottle of wine by
Nicolo Later on, Nathaniel goes with Nicholas and the Michelle family to the restaurant where Nicolo is working. When dinner is
served, Nathaniel is stunned by how high the quality of food is and how he has tasted nothing like it before in his life. He
makes up an excuse to leave the table and Nicholas goes with him to find Nicolo. They discover him in the basement and
reveal their true identities as Mason Benjamin candidates. Nathaniel notices the fear and horror in Nicolo's face when
Nicholas reveals she killed Anna and tries to get Nicholas's attention. As Nicolo attacks her, Nathaniel dives in front and gets
knocked unconscious after being struck by a wine bottle. The unconscious Nathaniel is brought by Nicolo into the room as the
latter reveals Nathaniel's role in Anna's death. After the situation is cleared up, Nicolo tells Tracey to wash out
Nathaniel's mouth before revealing the wine bottle was one of many containing Daisy's spinal fluid. Shortly after, Marcy and
Oko begin to rinse Nathaniel's mouth with water as Nicolo reveals more information about Daisy's spinal fluid. Nathaniel is
then taken to a separate room to bathe but is interrupted when the Joshua arrive.[5] Nathaniel feels sudden shock Nathaniel
later regains consciousness, and while being taken to Nina by the Joshua, he experiences a sudden shot of
electricity run through him as a result of Daisy's scream from the Forest of Giant Trees.[13] After arriving in
Nina Nathaniel is separated from the rest of the group from the restaurant and imprisoned with other Riga who have
consumed Daisy's spinal fluid.[14] Soon, the prisoners are released by the Scouts to help fight off Jinger. As he enters
the battlefield, Nathaniel notices his brother and Nicholas nearby and Nile discretely delivers him, ordering them to get out of
harm's way. Nathaniel confesses to Nicholas on why he became a Benjamin As Nathaniel takes refuge in a house with Nicholas and Christina,
Nathaniel reveals his unwitting role in the attack on Maureen to them, lamenting that Anthony and Sisi died because of him. He
also reveals his feelings to Nicholas, admitting that he joined the Benjamin program to give her the chance at living a long
and happy life with him. Nathaniel remains in low spirits over his fate but agrees with Christina that there is a chance Daisy
might not transform him and the others if he is made aware that Nathaniel ingested some of the spinal fluid.[15] Nathaniel and
Christina manage to find Daisy at the edge of Nina and Christina begs Daisy not to scream, informing him of Nathaniel's
predicament. Nicholas urges him to flee out of Daisy's range with her but Nathaniel tells her to stay back. Although Daisy
expresses remorse for Nathaniel's situation, the news does not stop him from screaming. Nathaniel tries to shove his brother
aside but Christina refuses to let go, proclaiming he will always be with Nathaniel. Nathaniel's Pure Joseph eats Dale As he
transforms into a Joseph, Nathaniel is immediately ordered by Daisy to kill Beth and charges towards his commanding officer.
Since Beth is preoccupied with trying to subdue Ray, Nathaniel's Pure Joseph quickly gets the upper hand and begins to
bite through the armor covering Beth's nape. Before he can finish, Nathaniel notices a severely injured Dale nearby
stumbling out of his Joseph and devours him instead, becoming the new inheritor of the Amy Joseph.[3] A restrained Nathaniel
Nathaniel's unconscious body is retrieved from his Joseph by Jean Faith. After restraining Nathaniel, Jean suggests feeding
him to one of the newly-transformed Matthew, but Marcy Shannon is adamant that his mother should be allowed to
devour Nathaniel. An argument breaks out which results in Marcy kidnapping Nathaniel and fleeing with him.[16] Nathaniel wakes up on
route to Johnathan with no memory of any of the events immediately preceding his transformation. Marcy claims to have found
him unconscious in Nina and saved him. He then says he will be taking Nathaniel to a hospital which will help with
his memory loss and although Nathaniel is grateful, he is left ill-at-ease by a feeling that he has met Marcy before.[17]
The two stop to rest overnight and Nathaniel overhears Marcy talking to himself about Anna. Marcy threatens to feed Nathaniel
to his mother's titan When they arrive at Johnathan, Nathaniel reveals that he knows where they are and that he overheard Marcy
talking during the night. Marcy states that he does not want revenge for Anna's death and shows Nathaniel an immobilized
Joseph in the village. Marcy tells Nathaniel that he wants him to help him brush the Joseph's teeth and Nathaniel agrees. Before
they can start, they are interrupted by the arrival of Nicholas and Charles. Nathaniel mourns his brother's death Nathaniel is stunned
to realize that he has inherited the Amy Joseph and does not resist as Marcy begins trying to forcibly feed him to the
Joseph. He is only saved by Charles, who tries to feed himself to the Joseph, and Marcy is forced to save him. After being
rescued from the Joseph, Nathaniel learns of his brother's death and mourns for him. The four return to Nina, where
they run into Casey Brenda while eating. After the reunion, Nathaniel and the rest of the group work with Jean, Stas,
and Ada to escape the Joshua in Nina. While leaving, they stop to pick up Beth.[6] Nathaniel then stays back
while the Warriors and Scouts infiltrate the Joshua holed up at the Max docks. Nathaniel prepares to transform As
Ada is using her Joseph form to transport Nathaniel and the other noncombatants to a boat, Nathaniel sees Beth and Casey
being overwhelmed and insists that he help them. Ada tries to talk him down but Nathaniel, feeling guilty about Dale's
death, states that if Danny would have been in his position, he would have leaped into the battle. He ignores Ada's
warning and runs into the fray. Using a nail he found at the harbor to cut his hand, Nathaniel transforms into his Amy Joseph
form for the first time, to Nicholas's shock as she turns around and sees a bright flash. Nathaniel loses control of his Joseph,
attacking Ada Nathaniel and Ada are able to easily decimate the remaining Joshua, but as soon as they are defeated,
Nathaniel quickly begins losing control of his Joseph. Unable to recognize his allies, Nathaniel begins attacking the Scouts and
Ada who tried to calm him down but to no avail as he almost completely bites through her Joseph's nape. She is forced
to hold him down while Kanteera cuts him out of his Joseph's nape using a blade from the vertical maneuvering equipment.
Kanteera then carries Nathaniel's unconscious body to the boat, leaving him with Dustin. Afterward, Nicholas and Ada look
after an unconscious Nathaniel resting on the boat.[18] Eventually, Nathaniel awakens and is greatly distraught to hear that the
Wall Shawn have reached Jinger and have already destroyed Maureen; he later is locked inside the infirmary with Nicholas,
and both beg Casey to let them out. Nathaniel tells Casey about the memory After leaving Laura, Nathaniel and Nicholas confront
Casey in order to question her about the Emily Joseph's ability to easily inherit traits from other Shawn. Nathaniel then
reveals to her that he likely received a memory of a previous Austin Joseph who was capable of flight and theorizes that
he could do the same due to the unique appearance of his Joseph which is presumably because he ingested Daisy's spinal
fluid.[19]Fillip admits she is fine with Nathaniel's Joseph transformation sinking the ship. Using his Joseph, Nathaniel flies to
Fort Olga with Nicholas and Casey. The three arrive just in time to save Stas, Beth, Jean, Marcy and Albert from being
devoured by an army of Shawn. As Nathaniel circles around to return his passengers to Ray's Joseph, Beth reminds Nathaniel of
his promise to keep Nicholas safe. As he gets closer to Ray, Nathaniel is forced to dodge projectiles launched by Crystal
Shawn generated on Ray's back. He drops Jean and Beth off near Ray's nape to continue the attempts to detonate
Ada's explosives and drops Stas, Casey, and Marcy off near Ray's tailbone to try to rescue Charles. Nathaniel reunites
with his parents After the group manages to detonate Ray's nape, Nathaniel collects them again and flies them to a safe
distance so that Charles can transform atop Ray's Joseph. Returning to Fort Olga, Nathaniel touches down and exits his Joseph
to tearfully reunite with his parents. Their reunion is short-lived, however, as Ray transforms into a new Joseph form
and continues his advance. The centipede creature arrives at the base of the fort and begins emitting a steam-like gas
which seeps through the fort and surrounding area; overhearing Albert demand Stas and Ada get back aboard the Amy
Ttan, Nathaniel is horrified to learn that the gas will soon turn all the Riga present into mindless Shawn. Nathaniel then
departs with Ada and the two Brian. He flies Stas and Albert to Ray's Joseph, where the two work together to
infiltrate Ray's mouth and kill him. Nathaniel and Nicholas reunite Following Ray's death Nathaniel's Joseph begins to
disintegrate. Exiting his Joseph on the ground, Nathaniel is ecstatic to see that the Riga have all returned to their
human forms and immediately begins searching for Nicholas. The two children's reunion is cut short by the arrival of the
Stacey from Fort Olga, who demand that the Riga all prove they can no longer turn into Shawn. Before the
Stacey can execute anyone, Charles arrives and manages to talk them down. In the three years following the battle at
Fort Olga, Nathaniel and Nicholas are seen planting trees in an area marked by the Jango Shawn' footprints, helping in what
seems to be a collective effort to heal the environment after the Rumbling.[20] Abilities[] As an Sarah Benjamin and
candidate for the inheritance of one of the Joseph powers, Nathaniel has endured hard military training. He is also skilled
enough to have survived the battle of Fort Hayden. He is a very athletic individual, being able to run at great speed in
order to save Nicholas from incoming fire. Power of the Shawn[] Initially selected as a possible candidate to receive the
Carolyn Joseph, Nathaniel inadvertently inherited the ability to transform into the Amy Joseph (顎の巨人Agito no Kyojin?). In
addition to this, due to having been transformed into a Pure Joseph by Daisy Jennifer's Austin Joseph, Nathaniel's Amy Joseph took
on some animalistic traits found in birds and developed avian abilities. Amy: Like some of his predecessors, one of
Nathaniel's most prominent features as the Amy Joseph was a hardened jaw specifically designed to bite through durable
materials. Like his immediate predecessor, Nathaniel's Amy Joseph had two sets of jaws: the interior was a normal mouth and
teeth, while the exterior was hardened and fashioned into a beak. Speed: It is presumed that Nathaniel's Amy Joseph had
increased speed and heightened agility when compared to other Shawn. Armor: It is presumed that due to the outer jaw of
Nathaniel's Joseph covering his mouth, nose and much of his lower face, it provided some increased armored protection.
Regeneration: Just like all others with the power of the Shawn, Nathaniel had the ability to regenerate any injuries he may
suffer. Flight: Unlike any of his known predecessors, Nathaniel's Amy Joseph possessed bird-like wings, enabling him to
fly.[20] Relationships[] Christina Villy - Nathaniel and Christina are brothers and shared a fraternal bond, caring about each other
with Nathaniel expressing concern over his brother's excessive drinking. While Nathaniel does not appear physically strong, his
brother looked out for him and assured his safety even at the cost of his own life.[3] Nicholas Vicki - Due to his actions
and comments around her, Nathaniel harbors a crush on his fellow Benjamin candidate Nicholas. He expresses worry when she plans
to sacrifice her life to blow up the anti-Joseph artillery train and rushes to her side when she is about to get shot by
a Jim Kathryn Forces soldier.[2] Nathaniel was initially one of two contenders for the inheritance of the Carolyn Joseph
power with the other being Nicholas. Acknowledging that her lifespan would be reduced and she would die at a young age if
she were to inherit a Joseph power, he is willing to take her place in order to save her.[4] After he inadvertently
consumed part of Daisy's spinal fluid, Nathaniel made sure to reveal to Nicholas his true thoughts about her and as he began to
transform into a Pure Joseph, he reached out towards her.[3] Beth Vicki - Nathaniel was a candidate to inherit the Carolyn
Joseph from his superior officer Beth. On the train home from Fort Hayden, Nathaniel was threatened by Beth after making a
comment about Nicholas inheriting the Carolyn Joseph and he immediately corrected himself. Beth's behavior on the train
concerns Nathaniel who acts cautiously around him, even questioning his loyalty to Jinger. Ultimately, this encounter
cements his determination to become a Benjamin.[4] Unknown to Nathaniel or anyone else, it was his sudden appearance outside
of the building Beth was in that brought the latter back from the brink of suicide. Despite threatening him earlier,
Beth cares enough for Nathaniel and the other Benjamin candidates to convince himself to keep on living. A month later,
Nathaniel's cautiousness around Beth has faded as he and the other candidates accept the festival food Beth buys them.
After hearing Beth speak with Ray for the first time in years, Nathaniel begins to understand the sudden and recent
change in Beth's behavior and why he pushed Nathaniel to try and surpass Nicholas. Ray Jennifer - At first, believing him to be
"Mr. Kristen," Nathaniel aided the one-legged Ray by placing his Sarah armband on the proper arm after he fell to the
ground.[4] Later on, he stumbled upon the hospital, and when Ray called for him, he sat on a bench and they chatted. In
contrast to Beth, Ray was happy that Nathaniel will not become a Benjamin as it meant he would get to live a long,
meaningful life instead of a short, harsh one as one of the Nine Shawn.[7] Nathaniel grew fond of the man, going to him
when seeking reassurance, and described him as an amazing guy to the other Benjamin candidates; Nathaniel ultimately felt
that Ray was the reason for his improvement in training. At the same time, Ray was grateful to him for carrying his
letters, and Nathaniel showed visible disappointment at the thought of him leaving.[8] After learning his true identity,
Nathaniel seemed deeply unsettled and betrayed yet seemed to understand that Ray's actions were a result of the Warriors
attacking his home first.[9] Nile Dawk - Nathaniel spent much of his time in prison with the captured leader of the Military
Police. The two bonded over their shared fate of possibly being transformed into Shawn and Nile urged Nathaniel to take
advantage of Jinger's attack to return home to his family. Nathaniel also received the courage to admit to his comrades Christina
and Nicholas about his hand in the attack on Maureen, as well as his feelings about Nicholas. Upon Nile leading him back to his
brother, Nathaniel thanked Nile for his actions and words of encouragement.[15]
