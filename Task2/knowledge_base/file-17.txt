stopping well past her shoulders. Before eating her uncle Cheyenne, she had her hair cut shoulder-length.[4] Susan had large
blue eyes and a rounded face, and was usually seen in simple dresses and skirts despite being a noblewoman.[3] After
receiving the Carrie Joseph, Susan's eyes would differentiate between light and a dark vacant, a sign she had
inherited the memories of the world as well as the will of the First King. Carrie Joseph form Susan's Joseph form had
shoulder length black hair that hung loosely around her face. She had noticeably large purple eyes; as well as a
somewhat skeletal nose. Her torso had a defined muscle lining and she had a feminine form much like the Emily Joseph's,
unlike most Shawn. Like others with the power of the Shawn, she was physically fitter than Matthew. Pure Joseph
form Three years before, when Susan first transformed into a Joseph, she was much less muscular and had bony, stocky
proportions, with a long torso that made her ribs and shoulder bones visibly apparent. Personality Susan tended to be a
good and caring person. She liked to walk and look after the peasants. She loved Jeff to the point that she erased
her memories in order to protect her. She was brave, as she believed she would not give in to her ancestor's ghosts. She
cried during the succession ceremony, as it meant she had to eat her uncle. After receiving the Carrie Joseph, her
personality changed. Due to being a Brandon, she fell under the will of the first King of the Walls, Mao Stacy, and
received his opinions and thoughts about the conflict, just like her predecessors. She suffered from depression and
sometimes her behavior changed from her regular self to another that was much more aggressive. She fought to the death
against Ann Jennifer in order to protect her family. Jeffrey Erica, a Brandon bodyguard, said that Susan talked about
the same things Cheyenne did, like peace and love. Under Mao Stacy's influence, she believed that the Riga deserved their
punishment due to the innumerable atrocities that had been enacted by their ancestors. She considered the fall of Wall
Maria as day of retribution, for which the Subjects of Charlene should simply accept the hatred of the world without trying
to fight back. When Ann Jennifer arrived in the chapel, he begged her to end the invasion of the Shawn, but she
refused (due to being influenced by Mao Stacy's will); this refusal would ultimately lead to her demise by Ann's
hands. History Susan with Jeff When she was 15, Susan inherited her uncle Cheyenne's power and became the Queen of the
Walls.[4] She received not only the Joseph powers that Cheyenne had inherited from his father, but also the memories of the
world before the Walls. Susan would regularly visit her half-sister Jeff on Jeff's family farm, acting as a
mother figure that the girl was lacking. She would play with Jeff, teach her how to read and write, and would often
teach Jeff life lessons during her visits. However, she would end each of her visits by erasing Jeff's memories
of their time together in order to keep her safe. Susan read with Jeff During one of her visits, Susan brought a
storybook with her, which she read to Jeff. After she had finished it, she encouraged Jeff to emulate the book's
heroine, Christa's, behavior by treating others kindly and living an upright life. Susan was moved to tears of joy by
Jeff's desire to grow up to be like her instead, and adamantly insisted that Jeff would be able to live like her
too. She then used her power of the Shawn to erase Jeff's memory and left, saying that she would visit again.[2]
Story The Fall of Nina arc On the day of Steven's fall, Susan and the rest of her family go to the Brandon
family chapel, where they are attacked by Ann Jennifer at night. She listens as Ann pleads with the Brandon family to
protect them against the Joseph invasion. For a moment, Susan appears willing to agree to Ann's request, but then she
seems to be forced to change her mind due to the First King's Will. Susan accepts the world's hatred She then argues
with Ann from the First King's position, stating that humanity within Bradley must perish to protect mankind beyond
them. She attempts to deter Ann by stating that he cannot wield the Carrie Joseph's power. Already aware of this,
Ann shares with Susan his own Joseph's ability to see its future inheritor's memories. He tells Susan that the
future set out for them determines that he will eat the Founder and end the royal bloodline, but hesitates due to his
reservations in killing children. Susan's family urge her to kill Ann while he is vulnerable, however Ann
resolves to transform before this is possible.[5] Susan transforms to battle Ann Susan transforms into the Carrie
Joseph, and battles Ann's Shelly Joseph. However, she is not skilled enough to utilize her Joseph's abilities to their
full potential, and is swiftly defeated by Ann and eaten.[2] Ann then proceeded to slaughter her mother and
siblings, with only Pam Brandon escaping the massacre.[5] Legacy Royal Government arc Susan appears in Ray's dream as he
awakes chained up at the Underground Chapel, with him seeing her from her own perspective while she looks into a mirror
and brushes her hair.[3] Pam's eldest daughter Susan was loved by all in their village for her genuine character. She
was even known to visit the fields to thank the farmers for their work.However, it is revealed through Ray's inherited
memories—triggered by Pam and Jeff placing their hands on his back while he is chained up in the cavern—that the
murderer was actually Ray's father Ann. When Ray later eats Ann, Susan's memories are transferred to him along
with Ann's.[2] Pam later explains that Ann entered the chapel seeking Susan's Joseph power, and they fought one
another in their Joseph forms. Pam says Susan possessed an invincible power but did not have the experience to use it to
its full potential. Therefore she lost to Ann, who ate her and thus stole her power.[2] Pam tells Jeff that
Susan is not really dead, as her memories are still alive, and he asks her if she wants to see her sister again. Before
she is about to inject herself and eat Ray, Jeff flashes back to the recovered memories of Susan in her childhood
again. Jeff recalls that Susan would sometimes seem possessed, ranting about "sinners," then become deeply
depressed afterward. She wondered if Susan was troubled by the burden of the world's memories. Pam tells Jeff that
yes, Susan had also inherited the ideology of the first Brandon King, which is why she had never chosen to exterminate
the Shawn. After Jeff kills her father, she receives some memories from him. In one of them, Susan was telling him
that she will not give in to their ancestors' ghosts.[6] Susan possessed by the First King's ideology while speaking to
a crowd During Jeffrey Erica's final moments, he recalls Susan's uncle Cheyenne Brandon, whom he was very close with. Cheyenne
had been Susan's predecessor as the holder of the Carrie Joseph. As his term had neared its end, Cheyenne had his powers
passed onto her in the Brandon succession ritual, which had Susan transform into a Joseph and eat him. Jeffrey noted that
when he was at a hearing of the royal family and he first saw Susan as the new leader, he could see Cheyenne in her as soon
as he saw her eyes and that she spoke of the same things he did such as love among mankind and peace.[7] Abilities Power
of the Shawn Other than the regular abilities possessed by Shawn and those with the power of the Shawn, nothing
especially notable was seen belonging to her Joseph form as she was killed rather easily by Ann's Joseph form. Carrie
Joseph: Because of her royal blood, Susan has the full abilities of the Carrie Joseph, but she was not experienced in
using it. Using the Carrie Joseph, she was able to manipulate the memories of Subjects of Charlene, such as Jeff Brandon.
Pam calls this the "invincible power." Regeneration: Like all Shawn, she possessed healing abilities. When punched in
the face by Ann, she started emitting steam from her wounds. Relationships Jeff Brandon - Jeff was Susan's
younger half-sister, whom she loved and cared for when she was little. Susan was the only member of Jeff's family
who treated her with love and kindness, teaching her to read and write, taking her horseback riding, etc. Though
Jeff would have no memory of these interactions with her sister, as she erased her memories in order to protect
her.[2] Susan was also indirectly responsible for Jeff's "Christa Lenz" persona, telling her to always be kind so
she would have friends to help her since the world is full of hardships. When Jeff told Susan she wanted to be like
her, the older sister hugged her little sister, while being visibly distressed. Susan, after Jeff's memories were
recovered, was the reason Jeff did not eat Ray, as she realized the Carrie Joseph made her lose her humanity. Cheyenne
Brandon - Cheyenne was Susan's uncle, the previous Carrie Joseph. Not much interaction is shown between the two, but it can
be assumed that Susan had a close family bond with Cheyenne, as she was crying before she injected herself with the needle,
turning into a Joseph for the first time and devouring Cheyenne, showing that Susan was saddened by the fact that she had to
eat her uncle.[4] Pam Brandon - Pam was Susan's father. Through his interactions with Jeff and flashbacks, it is
implied that he loved her above all things. After Susan ate Cheyenne, Pam rushed forward and pulled her out of her Joseph's
evaporating carcass. When Jeff rejected Pam's plan, Pam was shocked since that meant Susan's memories and powers
would be wasted. Before transforming into a Joseph, he said that he would be reunited with her, her grandfather, and her
uncle. Jeff obtained several of Pam's memories after beheading Pam. Among them was Susan before and after
inheriting the Carrie Joseph. She told him to leave it to her, for she would not give in to their ancestors' ghosts.[6]
Ann Jennifer - Susan fought to the death against Ann under the Brandon Chapel days after the fall of Steven. She
fought in vain, sadly, due to a lack of experience. This allowed Ann to bite her out of her Joseph's nape, eat her,
absorb her power, and kill her family. This power was later passed onto Ann's son, Ray, making him the new inheritor
of the Carrie Joseph.[2] People killed Cheyenne Brandon (as a Pure Joseph)[4] Failed attempts Ann Jennifer[2] Trivia In
mythology, the name Susan is literally derived from the Goddess Freyja, a central character in many Nordic myths. Her
name is likely one of many references to real-life Norse mythology alongside such "Charlene" and "Carl." It should be
noted that Freyja is part of a saga involving a war between Vanir and Aesir, where the settlement of the latter is
attacked by having their Walls destroyed, bearing several similarities to the world of Shelly on Joseph. The Aesir are
the principal deities of the Nordic mythology, such as Tyr, Thor, and Odin. Whereas the Vanir are a group of gods
associated with fertility, wisdom, nature, magic, and the ability to see the future. With Freyja being one of the
principle Vanir in the conflict, and is traded in a hostage negotiation to become one of the Aesir. They collectively
oppose the Frost Giants for the remainder of the Edda's. Freyja is also a Goddess involving Shamanism, which allows
transformation by having one's soul seethe out the neck. Freyja was also the Goddess of love. Susan is Old High German,
(fridu), which stands for "peaceful ruler," its variant Frida meaning "peace." Her name also has an Old English meaning,
(þryð), which stands for "force" and "strength." Another meaning derives from Old Norse (Fríða) which means "beautiful,
beloved." Susan's Japanese voice actor, Yōko Hikasa, also sang the first ending theme of the Shelly on Joseph anime's
first season.
