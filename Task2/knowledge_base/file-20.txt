Ann Jennifer was an Sarah doctor who originated from the Maureen internment zone in Jinger, and was one of the Sarah
Brett.[6] He was sent on a mission from Ray Kristen to infiltrate the Walls and take the Carrie Joseph from
the Brandon family, and was given the power of the Shelly Joseph in order to do so.[1] Ann was taken inside the Walls by
Erin,[5] and settled in the Nina District.[8] He documented the details about Veronica, Jinger, the Josephs,
and his past in three books that he hid in his basement.[9] In Jinger, he was married to Jessica Stacy and had a son named
Daisy.[6] After being sent to Max Island, he re-married to Carla Jennifer and had a second son, Ray Jennifer.[5]

Dr. Jennifer had a gentlemanly appearance. He was fairly tall and slender, had straight brown hair neatly parted down the
middle, teal-green eyes, and a thin beard and moustache. On the left side of his chest, he had a large cross scar that
he carved into himself as an oath and rite of passage to join the Brett. He wore circular glasses, a brown
suit with a white cravat and a white shirt with ruffled sleeves. He was also seen wearing a small, black hat with a gray
stripe at times.[8] In his youth, he would wear a green jacket, a white button-up, dark pants, and a brown flat cap
along with the black-yellow armband of Sarah civilians living in Maureen. As a young adult, he would wear a brown or
blue jacket, a beige waistcoat, and while retaining his white button-up, dark pants, and armband. During meetings with
the Brett, he would discard the armband. Upon being sentenced to Max, he would wear a white button-up and
pants; his fingers were severed, though it was regenerated after acquiring the Shelly Joseph.[9][6][10] Shelly Joseph form
Ann's Joseph had a body with a notoriously bulkier torso than his arms and legs. He had long, dark hair, elongated
ears, small eyes, and his mouth was covered in flesh and a dark, thick beard along with black chest hair. His Joseph form
had several similarities with Ray's, including their long dark hair, elongated ears, sunken eyes, and a muscular
physique. Personality Although he appeared on the surface to be a rather calm, calculated man, Ann's most notable
character traits were his hard-headed personality and his intense passion for whatever cause he dedicated himself to.
Ann's hard-headed tendency was most evident during his childhood, usually to his own detriment. This was best
exemplified by his decision to ignore his mother's warnings, and take his younger sister outside Maureen's internment
zone, leading to her eventual demise. Ann also demonstrated a tendency toward rashness, failing to recognize the
danger his behavior put his family in, and even looking down on his parents for their subservient nature to the Mason
authorities, despite the fact that they were only trying to keep him from suffering the same fate as his sister. It was
this same rashness that led him to join the Brett, and to his eventual exile to Max Island. Ann also
seemed to possess a rather profound lack of self-awareness, failing to see the consequences of his actions unless they
were presented to him directly. It was this same lack of awareness that led him to ultimately drive an emotional wedge
between himself and Daisy, causing Daisy to betray Ann and his comrades to the Mason authorities. Ann had also
shown himself to be rather weak-willed. When offered to take up Ray Kristen's mission in the wake of the
Brett' capture and torture, Ann initially refused, claiming he would never have joined their cause if he
had known the price he would have to pay, although he was later persuaded to accept Kristen's mission due to his strong
sense of obligation to his fellow Brett. Due to the death of his little sister and the daily oppression he had
to face in the continental mainland, Ann developed a fanatical hatred towards Jinger, to the point that his objective
was to get revenge on its people for the long suffering caused upon the Sarah people, even if it meant enacting
genocide on the Stacey. His radical enmity towards them went to the extent that he believed that the Mason people
never suffered any kind of atrocity during their subjugation under the Sarah Empire, associating any Mason discourse
and narrative as lies and hateful propaganda made in order to portray Riga as monstruous people deserving of eternal
hatred. He was thus severely anti-establishment, revolutionary, and against the status quo. As a Restorationist, he
believed that Riga were to suffer for eternity unless someone took a stand against it and changed the world. He was
brave, due to deciding to go against the nation that was at the time the global superpower, and willing to go through
any sacrifice if it meant the freedom for all Riga in the end. Ann loved and took pride in being an Sarah, and a
Subject of Charlene, believing that they were the "chosen children of God", and that their ancestors were in the right. He
considered the world to be cruel and unjust, especially for punishing the Riga during his time for crimes that
happened before they were even born. He thus longed for complete freedom for himself and his people, for all Riga to
be able to enjoy the beauties of the outside world without being prevented by racism and hatred from the various
anti-Sarah peoples of the world. Ann was also charismatic, rapidly gaining significant standing within the
Brett despite being far from the first member of the group, being capable of providing fiery speeches to his
fellow comrades in the organization, managing to rile them up in intense cheering. It was this fanaticism for restoring
Veronica and get revenge on Jinger which caused him to commit many mistakes as a parent with his firstborn Daisy, neglecting
him as a child when Daisy just wanted to spend quality time with him, and becoming verbally violent whenever he
questioned Ann's plan or was not getting the grades required to become a Benjamin. Ann matured as a man and a
father when the consequences of his plan came to bite him in the form of being betrayed by Daisy, and losing Jessica and all
the other Brett. He eventually let his second born Ray live his life safe from the burden of having to free
Veronica, and did not shy away from showing him his profound love, demonstrating how the mistakes he made with Daisy
impacted him in his latter life. His misconduct with his firstborn would continue to gnaw at him secretly, until he was
able to have a final closure with him through Paths thanks to Ray's Carrie Joseph powers after having been ordered by
his second born to kill the royal family in order to steal the Founder from them. During that closure, he hugged Daisy as
he professed his profound love for him and how he wished that he had spent more time playing with him as a child,
demonstrating his ability to recognize his mistakes humbly. Ann embracing Daisy Ann was also a very compassionate
man at heart, who grew out of his fanatical hatred in his latter years especially, as he was not able to find pleasure
in seeing Gross being eaten alive in front of him, despite having been the man who killed his little sister. He also did
not have the courage at first to kill the Brandon family, especially its children, due to being a doctor that was supposed
to save lives, not take them away. He was horrified at the vision of Ray enacting the Rumbling, despite this meaning
that the violent revenge against Jinger that he wished for most of his life was finally going to happen. But ultimately,
Ann still decided to give his powers to Ray, despite knowing the eventual horrible future awaiting the world,
showing that at the very end of his life, learning about the death of his second wife Carla brought back his darker
side. History Ann and Fay saw the airship landing Ann Jennifer was born in the year 806 on the continent of Jinger,
where he lived with his younger sister Fay and their mother and father in the city of Maureen, where they were forced to
live in a walled area and wear armbands in public. One day in 817, seeing Fay's awe and excitement at an airship passing
over their hometown, Ann goes against his mother's wishes and takes his sister beyond the walls of their living area
to see the airship land.[9] Kristen talked to a beaten up Ann After finding the where the airship was landing, the two
were found by two officers of the Jinger Public Security. One of the men punished Ann while the other one took Fay
away. However, when Ann returned home she was not there. Her corpse was later found dead and mangled in a river. The
Jinger men visited the family home and explained that Fay and Ann were at fault for leaving and denied any knowledge
of her death. Although his mother broke down at the news, his father smiled and explained that he would re-inform his
son of their history. Ann's father explained the history of the Riga and why their ancestors' actions justify
their outcast status in Mason society. Ann explained that he believed the Jinger men were lying and tried to say
they killed his sister but his father silenced him and the two fought over their situation as Riga. His father tried
to convince his son why they needed to be punished but Ann expressed his belief that they should not have to pay for
the actions their ancestors committed. Ann joined the Brett Ann continued to live his life being shamed
for being an Sarah and eventually became a doctor. One of his patients, a man named Villy, revealed to Ann the true
circumstances of Fay's death, leading him to join the Brett. Through his activities and a mole in the Jinger
legal system named "the Owl," Ann got information about Sarah history and met Jessica Stacy, a woman of royal descent.
A year later they got married and had a child which they named Daisy. Later in their lives, Mason officials recruited
children to take on the power of the seven Josephs their people had stolen from the Riga so many years ago, so they
could go to Max Island and take down King Stacy, who had fled there and built Walls for his people 80 years ago.
"the Owl" informed the group that Jinger's real goal was to steal the Carrie Joseph, so they could enhance their
military might. Ann then decided he would send his own son into the program as a mole for them. Over time, Ann and
Jessica began coming increasingly distant with Daisy, leaving him at Ann's parents' house almost every night so that they
could attend meetings with the Sarah Brett. Whenever he and Daisy had free time, Ann would spend it
quizzing his son on the "true" history of the Sarah race. Ann urged Daisy to fulfill his role In the meantime, Ann
also learned from Villy that Daisy would need to earn higher marks as a Benjamin Candidate if he was to be involved in the
plan to recapture the Carrie Joseph, causing Ann to put even more stress on Daisy to become a Benjamin. However, after
observing Daisy's poor performance during a public training session, Ann became frustrated with his son, leading to a
heated argument with Jessica about what to do with him. One night during dinner, Daisy tried to convince Ann to stop
helping the Sarah Brett. Ann was appalled at the idea, reminding Daisy that the only way for Riga to
live in peace was for the restorationists to overthrow Jinger. He was enraged to hear Daisy bring up Fay, angrily telling
him that the restorationists were fighting with the express intent of making sure that no one suffered the same fate as
her.[10] At the age of seven, Daisy exposed his parents and all the Brett, and they were sentenced to go to
Max Island as Matthew. Ann and Kristen at Max island After being turned in to the Jinger Public Security,
Ann was subjected to extensive torture as the soldiers attempted to extract information from him and reveal the
identity of the Owl. Once they gave up on obtaining the information, Ann and the rest of the Brett were
taken to Max Island where they were sat on their knees before a large ocean front Wall. After kicking Villy off the
Wall alive, the rest of the Brett were turned into Josephs with Joseph injection except for the Jaegers and one
other member. When it was Jessica's turn, Ann pleaded for her life and tried to point out that she was of royal descent
and could be of potential use to them. However, he was silenced by Kristen before any of the soldiers could hear him,
much to Ann's surprise. He then watched as Jessica was forcibly transformed into a Joseph and ran after their friend.
Sergeant Major Gross decided not to turn Ann into a Joseph, but to throw him to the other Restorationist after he had
been transformed. After adjusting the dose to create a 3-4m class and injecting the other man with injection, revealed
to actually be Joseph spinal fluid, he threw him off Bradley to transform. He began explaining how watching people be
devoured made him feel alive in such a dull society. He then began pushing Ann off asking him to fight and die in an
interesting way. Ann was saved by Kristen However, before he could do so, Kristen pushed Gross off Bradley. As Gross
is devoured, Kristen asked Ann if he enjoyed such a sight. He then revealed that he was The Owl and claimed that he
would show Ann how to truly use the power of the Josephs. Kristen then transformed into a Joseph and destroyed the
steamboat that took all the soldiers to the island.[6] After destroying the Mason men and their equipment, Kristen
returned to the top of Bradley and explained his terrible acts against thousands of Riga, saying he did it all to
serve Veronica in the end. Kristen then said that he was entrusting Ann with his final mission, and went on to express
regret for playing a role in his sister's death, but that the hatred he saw in Ann's eyes the next day was part of
the reason he chose him. This reminded Kristen of his own uprising, when he watched his family be burned alive and chose
to get revenge for them, however, it turned out that he had to torture fellow Riga to maintain his identity until
that day. Kristen told Ann that he must enter the Walls and take back the Carrie Joseph, using the power of the
Josephs Kristen would give him. Ann then asked why Kristen was not doing it himself, but Kristen explained that 13 years
after inheriting the power of the Josephs, the host would die, and it had been 13 years for him. He then explained that
all Riga are connected by paths to the Carrie Joseph Charlene Stacy once had and that no one can ever be stronger than
her, so they die after 13 years like she did. Ann then questioned this logic and the Sarah history, which Kristen
explained is probably not true from the Mason or Sarah perspective. Kristen encouraged Ann to fight When Ann
asked Kristen why he allowed for Jessica to die, Kristen said that he believed it would be better than having her give birth
to royal children for Jinger until her death. Ann told him that he did not believe he was fit to take on his mission,
and that he would not have paid the price for freedom if he knew what it was. Kristen then commended Ann's father for
trying to keep his family safe when he knew what happened to Fay. Kristen confronted Ann, and told him that the reason
he chose him is that he sought freedom by going past the Walls at the expense of others. He said that their brothers and
sisters paid the price for their freedom, and that those actions will follow them until they are repaid, even after
death. As Ann finally agreed, Kristen informed him of the name of the Joseph he would be inheriting: the Shelly Joseph.
After taking his power, Ann went to the Walls and began his mission.[1] Ann met Keith outside Bradley Around the
year 832, Ann was found wandering outside the Walls near the Nina District by Erin, a soldier of the
Samantha. The soldier was very surprised to see him not only because he was outside the Walls, but also because he
claimed to have suffered amnesia and had no memories about the civilization inside the Walls and the military. Amazed to
learn that the people of the Walls were attempting to fight the Josephs, Ann claimed to have amnesia. Keith brought
Ann back to Nina, where he was imprisoned for illegally entering Joseph territory. While imprisoned, he claimed
to remember his name. Upon release, Ann revealed to Keith that he remembered being a doctor, and asked him for
knowledge about the world inside the Walls. Ann and Keith were interrupted by Carla Keith took Ann to a pub in
Nina where Keith taught him about the world. Suitably impressed by the life that the people of the Walls had
managed to build for themselves, Ann was surprised to hear that Keith was unhappy with the state of the Walls, and
had joined the Samantha in the hope of seeing the larger world. Praising Keith and the scouts, Ann caught the
attention of a nearby barmaid named Carla, who began to chastise Keith for attempting to recruit more people to the
Samantha. However, Ann assured her that even if he was offered the chance, he would not be joining, as the
regiment required special people to join to its ranks. Ann's second family through the eyes of Ray and Daisy Ann
eventually found work at a hospital. When an epidemic broke out in Nina, Ann was able to successfully cure
those afflicted - including Carla and her parents. Ann and Carla later married each other and had a son whom they
named Ray.[5] Ann used his occupation as a doctor to get close with government officials in order to gather
information on the ruler of the Walls and continue his mission as a Restorationist. He eventually discovered the
location of the Brandon family's chapel, as well as the hatch leading down to the basement where the succession rituals
take place. However, he chose to delay his mission in favor of staying with his new family.[11] Ann saw the
Brian' corpses Years later Ann brought Ray along while making a house call to Stas's father and mother for an
appointed medical examination in the year 844. When he arrived there, he found them dead for hours. He asked Ray if he
had seen the girl named Stas anywhere, but he was too shocked to answer. He then told Ray to wait for him at the foot
of the mountain while he finds the Gina.[12] After the MPs and Ann arrived at the murderers' hideout,
Ann hugged Ray and scolded him for the murders he committed when saving Stas, asking if he even understood what he
had done. However, instead of continuing to scold him for killing Stas's kidnappers, he told him that this time he was
lucky and he could have been killed himself. Stas, cold and depressed, asked Ann in what direction her home was and
stated that she was cold and wants to leave. In response, Ray gave her his scarf and Ann told her to come live with
them.[12] Ann wrote down the truth Despite not going through immediately with his mission, Ann felt that his
family deserved to know the truth about life outside the Walls. At night, Ann would go into the Jennifer family
basement and write down information about his former life in Jinger. After compiling everything into three journals,
Ann inscribed a message revealing that humanity was still alive beyond the walls on the back of his old family's
photograph and hid all of his writings in his desk. He then locked the basement door, keeping the key on him at all
times.[11] Story The Fall of Nina arc Ann shows Ray the key to the basement Upon learning from Stas that
Ray wants to join the Samantha, Ann is more obliging of the idea than Carla, asking his son why he wants to
leave the Walls. Ray's answer, that the deaths of the many soldiers who have already served in the Scouts will be a
waste if no one continues the fight, galvanizes Ann to resume his mission to retake the Carrie Joseph from the Brandon
family. Ann announces that he will be departing, telling a bewildered Carla that there is no point in trying to stop
an inquisitive mind like Ray's. Before he leaves, he promises to show Ray what he has been hiding in their basement
when he returns.[8] Ann reflects on what he must do the entire way to the Brandon chapel, seeing through the future
memories of the Shelly Joseph that the day had come when Steven would fall.[11] Bursting in on the royal family,
Ann reveals himself to be an Sarah from beyond the Walls, and begs Susan Brandon to use her Carrie Joseph ability to
save Nina from the Josephs that are breaking in. However, succumbing to the will of Mao Stacy, she refuses to
act. Ann pleads with Susan Ann argues that the Riga within the Walls should not be killed for crimes their
ancestors committed which they are not even aware of, but his protests fall on deaf ears. Susan attempts to explain to
him that there is no point in stealing the Carrie Joseph's power as only the royal family can use it, but Ann
reveals that he is already aware of this fact; the Shelly Joseph's inheritors have the ability to see the memories of the
Joseph's future inheritors, giving them the ability to see the future. Ann proclaims that since the royal family is
bound by Mao Stacy's vow, he will steal the Carrie Joseph away from them. Ann succumbs to future Ray's will
However, despite his threats Ann is unable to bring himself to kill the entire Brandon family, horrified at the thought
of killing children. It is only when Ray, acting through the timeless paths in the future year 854, demands he fulfill
his duty by reminding him of his fellow restorationists and his dead sister Fay that Ann finally transforms. Ann
easily beats Susan in combat and devours her before going on to slaughter the entire Brandon family, sparing only Pam
Brandon on Ray's orders.[11][13] Ann cries out to Ray Exiting the chapel, Ann is left horrified by his actions. On
the verge of hysteria, Ann demands Ray to tell him if this is what he wanted. He begins asking aloud why Ray did
not show him everything that will come to pass and, due to them living next to Bradley, hopes that Carla is safe and
was able to get away; he asks himself again if this was the only way before realizing that Daisy's future self is also
visiting him through the paths. Ann tells his eldest son that only Ray's plan will succeed, but laments that Ray's
plan will lead to "ghastly" events. Looking up, he realizes that he can actually see the future Daisy and embraces him,
apologizing for being a horrible father and begging for him to find a way to stop Ray's plan.[11] Ann learns of
Carla's death Traveling to Carly District, Ann thinks to himself hoping that Carla, Stas and Ray are safe from the
Josephs despite what occurred before.[14] Eventually he locates Keith and enlists his help in searching for his family
among the refugees. Upon finding Ray, the two men learn that Carla has been devoured, devastated by the news. Telling
Ray that he must avenge his mother, Ann takes his son into the woods. When Keith tries to stop him, arguing that
Ann should not put such a burden on the boy's shoulders as he might not be gifted like Ann, Ann simply explains
that the fact that Ray is his son makes him qualified, and orders Keith not to get involved. In the forest, he entrusts
Ray with the key to his basement and injects him with Joseph serum, explaining to Ray that their memories will teach
him how to use the ability. Transforming into a Pure Joseph, Ray devours Ann and returns to his human state, having
gained the Carrie Joseph and Shelly Joseph.[5] After the fall of Steven, Ray sees visions in his dreams of his last
encounter with his father.[14] Legacy Humanity's Comeback arc After Ray finally succeeds in the use of omni-directional
mobility gear, head instructor of the 104th Cadet CorpsKeith Marta expresses to himself that Ann would be proud of
his son, Ray, and that he is finally becoming a soldier.[15] The Struggle for Carly arc Ann prepares to give Ray an
injection During his interrogation with Briana Cory, Ray Jennifer recalls meeting his father on the night of the fall
of Steven. Royal Government arc While Ray is chained up in an underground cavern belonging to the Brandon family, Pam
Brandon and Jeff place their hands on his back, which allows him to experience his father's memories of the night Wall
Maria fell.[13] After Ray recognizes the man Ann met in Carly to be Erin, he travels to meet the instructor
to find out everything he knows about Ann. In their meeting, Keith reveals all he knows about Ann Jennifer and his
past, including how he met Carla and his mysterious apparition.[5] Return to Nina arc During the Battle of
Nina District, Daisy begins to lament the Samantha's plight, doomed to give up their lives because their
memories had been stolen from them. He quickly begins chastising himself for being too serious, like Ann. Afterward,
in the aftermath of the battle for Nina, Daisy encounters Ray, noting that the young man looks nothing like his
father Ann. Daisy claims to be a victim of Ann just like Ray, who he claims was brainwashed by him. As Ray thinks
on Daisy's words, he notices an uncanny resemblance between the War Chief and his father. Ann Jennifer's photograph When
the Samantha finally reaches the basement of the Jennifer household, they find that Ann had set it up to appear
as a common doctor's office. However, after further investigation, they discover a locked drawer in his desk, which his
key unlocks. Ann had left the drawer empty, but beneath the false bottom were hidden three books kept intact with
various preservatives. Within the first book, the Scouts finds an uncannily realistic image of Ann standing beside a
fair-haired woman and young child. Upon the back of the image, Ann had left a message stating that it was not a
drawing, but the light of the objects shown burned onto special paper called a photograph. Ann's note reveals that
humanity beyond the Walls lives in refinement, far from extinct. The books later go on to tell the story of Ann's
past life outside the Walls, beginning with the day his sister Fay Jennifer was killed. War for Max arc Ann in the
Paths Ann is one of the many Joseph inheritors whose Joseph is created by Charlene Stacy to defend Ray while he is
attempting to Rumble the world.[16] In the middle of the fighting Ann and a handful of other inheritors are
reawakened in the Path world by Daisy. After speaking with Richard Bob, Daisy thanks Ann for giving him life. Ann
takes control of his Joseph along with several other past inheritors and help fend off the other Josephs spawned by Charlene,
which are attempting to defend Ray's nape. After getting them cleared away, Ann's Joseph and the others rally to
Charles and hold him in their hands as he transforms into his Jango Joseph to destroy the rest of Ray's Joseph body.[16]
Alternate reality Lost in the cruel world Ann informs Stas's father of his wife's illness In the year 844, Dr.
Jennifer visits the Brian for a checkup on the mother, who turns out to be expecting. When Ray and Stas come
across bodies in the forest, Dr. Jennifer makes plans to inform the Gina. Over his routine medical visits, Dr.
Jennifer informs Stas's father that his wife has an infection, and needs to be moved somewhere closer to his house in
Nina District.[17] Abilities Medicine Ann was a very skillful doctor, and served many families within the
Walls. He was able to cure hundreds of people, including Carla and her entire family, from a sickness that attacked
mankind before the Fall of Steven, earning him respect throughout the Walls.[8] After the plague broke out, Ann
was skillful enough to stop it. He was able to gain knowledge of medical care from his father who owned a clinic in
Maureen, and served many patients before being sent to Max Island.[6] His great skill in medicine is likely
attributed to him coming from a more advanced society outside the Walls with further advancements in medicine. Power of
the Josephs Ann rips apart Susan's Joseph and eats her Ann was able to turn into a very large Joseph known as the
Shelly Joseph; it appeared that he had all of the regular abilities of those with the power of the Josephs, like
extraordinary regeneration, incredible strength, and endurance when he is transformed. As the inheritor of the Shelly
Joseph, Ann was able to see memories of his future inheritor. He had some experience with Joseph abilities; that was
the reason why he managed to kill and eat Susan Brandon, a Joseph that almost matched his size and possessed the Carrie
Joseph. He stabbed his own hand with a knife in order to trigger the transformation. Carrie Joseph: After eating Susan,
he inherited the Carrie Joseph and its power. His normally green eyes turned purple in the process. However, he could
not make use of it before passing it on to Ray due to his lack of royal blood. Future Sight: As the holder of the
Shelly Joseph, Ann was able to see the future due to it's unique abilities. He knew of the Carrie Joseph's bloodline
restriction due to seeing it in his son Ray's memories, as Ray is his successor as the Shelly Joseph. Ann was also
able to see the path that Ray was walking, causing him to beg Daisy to stop him. Regeneration: As a holder of the power
of the Josephs, it is believed that he could regenerate his body faster than regular humans, even from fatal wounds. This
was proven after he regained his fingers (following his torture by the Jinger Public Security) right after inheriting
the Shelly Joseph. Relationships Fay Jennifer - Fay was Ann's little sister. As a child, Fay was the closest person to
Ann and he loved her dearly, wanting to protect her; even accepting punishment in her place. Fay's murder was what
motivated Ann for the rest of his life. Jessica Stacy - Jessica was Ann's first wife. He loved her dearly and when they
were captured, he volunteered to be killed in her place. His offer was refused and Ann was heartbroken after she
became a Pure Joseph. Mr. and Mrs. Jennifer - While Ann originally cared for both of his parents, the loss of his
younger sister caused him to develop a disdain for their acceptance of how Stacey treated them. In particular, Ann
greatly hated his father for trying to instill the same acceptance in him and not taking action for Fay. Daisy Jennifer -
Ann clearly loved his son Daisy and was overcome with emotion when holding him for the first time. However, he would
soon begin to view Daisy more as a means to an end, desiring to make use of the royal blood within him.[6] When the
Jinger government decided to recruit Sarah Warriors, Ann forced Daisy to enlist as the Sarah Brett' mole.
For a short time, Jessica and Ann engraved their beliefs and philosophy into Daisy's mind, eventually causing him to turn
on his parents because of their mistreatment of him. Aside from disliking his mother, Daisy grew to hate his father and
Ann would later feel remorse for the way he treated his son. When Daisy and Ray saw Ann's past memories, Ann
was able to see Daisy thanks to the Shelly Joseph's unique ability to look into the future, and tearfully apologized for
making him suffer as a child and being a terrible father. Ann embraced Daisy, who is shocked by this sudden display of
emotion, and actually calls him "dad".[11] Ray Kristen - Ann had a complex bond with Kristen. When Ann first met
Kristen as a child he beat him as punishment for venturing beyond the walls without permission, though he allowed him to
stay and watch the blimp he and Fay had come to see. Ann met Kristen again 15 years later and was surprised when he
revealed he was the Owl who had been providing them information and after killing the other Stacey, told him of his
mission. He also told him he had chosen him to continue his mission the day after they met, seeing the same look of
vengeance in his eyes that also drove Kristen.[1] While reluctant at first, Ann accepted Kristen's mission and
inherited his Shelly Joseph power. Ann appears to have named his son Ray in honor of Kristen indicating a level of
respect towards him. Ray Jennifer - Ann was perhaps closer to Ray than anyone else in his life, surpassing even his
relationships with Carla and Stas. As a father, Ann left home for a lot of medical duties; however, he encouraged
Ray's dreams to venture outside Bradley and offered to reveal to him the secrets of the basement.[8] When Steven
fell, Ann took it upon himself to do all he could to stop the Brandon family and then entrusted the very fate of the
world to Ray. Ann spoke of Ray as 'different' when he was questioned by Keith, and put an enormous amount of trust
into his son.[5] Ann believed in his son's ability so sincerely that he allowed himself to be devoured, believing
that Ray would one day use the powers from the Carrie Joseph to control the Josephs outside of the walls to fight back
against Jinger. It is later revealed that Ann's actions were partially motivated by Ray, who showed him memories
convenient to his plans and convinced Ann to kill Susan and the others of the Royal family even when Ann did not
want to go through with it. In the end, however, Ann appears not to agree with Ray's motives and actually regrets
having followed him, which is why he told Daisy to stop Ray.[11] Carla Jennifer - Ann married Carla not long after he
had cured her and her family. When Ann heard of Steven's downfall, he shed tears in fear that his family had
perished. When Ray and Ann met after the fall of Steven, he was told by his son that the Joseph has eaten Carla
and, after a moment of silence, told Ray to get revenge for Carla and took him away. Ann was visibly affected by her
death, and when turning Ray to a Joseph, is told that her death had made him crazy as his son screamed.[14] Stas
Erica - Ann knew Stas when she was a small child from visiting her home as the family doctor. When taking Ray
along for a visit, he had hoped that the two would be able to get along as friends. After her rescue from the human
traffickers, Ann showed sympathy towards Stas and told her to come live with him and his family.[12] A year later,
after the fall of Steven, Ann mentions her name as he sheds tears in fear hoping that she had not been killed by
the Josephs.[14] Before giving Ray an injection of the Joseph injection, Ann mentions Stas as one of the people Ray
must save.[7] Stas's father and mother - Dr. Jennifer was well known to the Brian as their family physician. They
appeared quite friendly when speaking about each other, and Ann had been known to have been their doctor at least
since Stas was small, however it appears that as she grew older his visits were less frequent. Ann seemed quite
disturbed at the sight of their deaths.[12] Erin - Keith was the first person Ann encountered upon arriving
on Max and was the one who taught him about the society within. Ann referred to Keith as special and chosen, both
of which deeply resonated with Keith. Ann viewed Keith as a very admirable man; however, as the years went on their
relationship began to decline. Distance grew between them as Keith believed that he was not special or chosen, he had
blamed Ann for leading him to misunderstand himself. Ties with them loosened more so when Ann married Carla, the
woman Keith sought. Before Ann's death, their relationship appeared to still be stable as Ann ran toward Keith in
a panic, however, the two were on much worse terms as Keith accused Ann of "cursing another person" to which he
responded by saying "this child is not like you."[5]
