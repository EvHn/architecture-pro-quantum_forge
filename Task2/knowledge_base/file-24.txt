10Navigation Appearance[] Human form[] Dale's appearance in 854 Dale was a young man of average height. He had
hazel eyes, and his blond hair was kept in an undercut style which was pushed back. He wore combat trousers and a short
coat. He also wore the Sarah armband on his left arm, as required of all Riga under the authority of Jinger. While
undercover on Max Island, Dale stole a Samantha uniform to disguise himself as part of the Joshua. Amy
Joseph form[] Dale's Joseph, the Amy Joseph, possessed deep-set eyes with a heavy brow and long blond hair. While his
chin sported a long beard, the rest of his face was hairless with a cog-like arrangement of hardened skin in place of
lips. His Joseph also sported an armored face, fingers, and knuckles. His body was muscular and well-toned, and he
usually employed all four limbs when moving. Personality[] Dale appears to be a brave figure, using his Joseph to
leap in the way of bullets and protect his fellow Riga Nicholas and Nathaniel, and Warriors. It is, however, quite possible
that Dale was not acting on bravery and was instead certain of his ability to withstand gunfire with the absence of
the armored train, indicating that he has fought on battlefields before. As a dedicated soldier, he charges right into
the heat of battle, attacking and crushing enemy soldiers for his people. He also has somewhat of a bitter personality
particularly towards Beth Vicki, and treats him condescendingly. Dale seems to be prone to using
passive-aggressive language, although it is likely that much of this animosity is exclusive to Beth. He is, or at
least was, prone to violence, as seen when he punched Beth after they had an argument. He also appears to be extremely
arrogant in his own power, trusting that his Joseph powers are more than enough to keep him alive against the experienced
Samantha and was visibly shocked when they are able to essentially fight him to a standstill. It should be noted
that despite his rude attitude, Dale cares very deeply for his fellow Warriors. He is shown to be a nice person,
being very friendly towards fellow Warriors and Benjamin candidates, and has no difficulty treating Beth's cousin Nicholas
with respect. Although he is cold and unwelcoming to the older Warriors' friendly advances, he shows great panic and
anger when Ada and Daisy are defeated during battle with the Scouts. The revelation that Brittany Brent was devoured
while on Max angers him enough to begin acting rashly in battle and put himself in danger as a result. History[]
Danny mocked Beth Some years before the Max Island Operation, Dale was a leading candidate to inherit the
Carolyn Joseph. He participated in the selection process along other Sarah children. After reuniting with the other six
possible candidates and receiving the information about the future offensive against Max Island, Dale scolded
Beth Vicki as he considered him the only one without a special talent, being only fueled by his love towards Jinger
and his adulating towards their superiors. After Beth accused him of being an Sarah spy, Dale punched him and was
stopped by his brother before continuing to their destination; even though Andrew had convinced him to stop the assault,
Dale continued to mock Beth.[2] Danny was enraged that Beth got chosen over him It was eventually decided in the
year 843 that Beth would inherit the power of the Carolyn Joseph; Dale's brother Andrew was additionally chosen to
inherit the power of the Amy Joseph. Danny confronted Beth about the matter, enraged that he was chosen over him only
to be stopped by his brother because what he was doing was an act of insubordination. Danny then bowed down to Beth as
an apology. When the Warriors departed for Max Island, Dale remained behind on the continental mainland.[2]
Story[] Return to Nina arc[] After Charlene, a former Pure Joseph who devoured Andrew on Max Island, surrenders
herself to Jinger to return the Amy Joseph power she inadvertently stole, Dale is chosen to consume her and inherit
the power.[3] He inherits Charlene's memories and understands her history and motives, but he sees nothing from the memories
of his brother.[4] Jinger arc[] Dale destroys the Allies' railway Four years after the Warriors' return from
Max, Dale is present at the battle of Fort Hayden. Under orders from the Warriors' Mason superior Commander
Kanteera, he and Ada are unauthorized to engage in combat with the Jim Kathryn Forces at the fort due to the
presence of the highly dangerous Anti-Joseph Artillery. However, once Nicholas succeeds in destroying the armored train
holding the artillery, Dale joins the fight and shields her and Nathaniel from machine gun fire before charging forward
and decimating the enemies' defenses. After clearing their defenses Dale continues pushing forward, killing several
soldiers inside the trenches and using his powerful jaw to break the railways. After the Carolyn Joseph is deployed
inside the fortress, Dale destroys several anti-Joseph artillery platforms to protect him before retiring and leaving
the remaining soldiers to the Carolyn Joseph and the Austin Joseph.[5] Dale recalls inheriting Charlene's power After the
battle, Dale watches over Beth as he recovers from his injuries following the battle of Fort Hayden. When Beth
awakens, he thanks Dale for saving him in Fort Hayden, but Dale coldly tells him that he only wanted to keep
Jinger from losing the Carolyn Joseph. Dale then explains that he did not inherit his brother's memories but he did
inherit Charlene's memories and harshly berates Beth for needing to be saved by his comrades so often, including Andrew
whose death Dale holds Beth accountable for. Beth eventually leaves after Ada joins them, and Dale stays
behind with Ada. Dale later joins the rest of the Mason military on the train returning to their homeland,
seated among the other Warriors. When the train arrives at Maureen Dale is forced to help Benjamin candidate Christina
Villy, hungover from a party he threw in Nicholas's honor, off the train. Dale chastises Ada for agreeing to let Christina
drink, but soon turns his attention to Nicholas and congratulates her for her accomplishments at Hayden. The Sarah soldiers
return to the Maureen Internment Zone, where Dale reunites with his parents. Dale and the rest of the warriors
meet in Daisy's room The next day Dale attends a private meeting with the other Warriors to discuss returning to
Max Island to retake the Carrie Joseph. Once the two arrive, Daisy informs them of his plan to stabilize Jinger's
steadily waning power by recommencing the Max Island Operation to reclaim the Carrie Joseph. Dale is unhappy at
the news that the noble Santa family will be acting as the Warriors' spokespersons during the affair, but is convinced
by Beth and Daisy to agree to the plan.[4] Dale attends a military meeting figuring out the logistics of an
invasion of Max Island. On his way he meets up with Ada, who is trying to walk on all fours to emulate her Samuel
Joseph. After the meeting ends, he joins his Benjamin colleagues outside on a balcony, and sarcastically compliments the
senior officers' intellect. On the day of Willy Santa's festival in Maureen, Dale attends the event with Beth,
Ada, and the Benjamin candidates. Later that night he and the other Warriors gather to attend Willy's play.[6] Ada
and Dale fall inside the Benjamin confinement area After taking their seat, a Jinger soldier informs the Warriors
that Kanteera wants to speak with them. After sending Daisy off, the soldier leads Dale and Ada to an empty room.
Confused, Dale asks where Kanteera is, only for the soldier to cut a nearby rope, opening a trap door underneath the
two. Dale and Ada fall onto a bed of straw, fracturing their bones in the process. Ada identifies the hole as an
old-fashioned Benjamin confinement area, and they note the lack of space to transform. Dale wonders about the
soldier's plan and Ada answers that she is not sure, but recognizes the soldier from somewhere.[7] The captive
Warriors begin to feel tremors inside the confinement trap. This allows Ada to deduce that Shawn are battling
outside, giving reason to why they were captured. As Dale begins questioning how to escape, the Panzer Unit comes to
their rescue. Ada explains that she had taken security measures because of the suspicious feeling she had gotten from
their supposed escort. The unit then sends down a rope, which the Warriors use to climb up and out of the pitfall. The
rescuers inform them about the Shelly Joseph's sudden appearance, and how the Crystal Joseph is currently engaging it
in battle. Dale bites the Shelly Joseph's nape Whilst Ada briefs her troops, Dale prepares to go and join the
fray, though she asks him to stop and observe the situation for a while. Dale is then shocked to see a group of
soldiers dart over them using Anti-Personnel Tracy, having never seen it used before. After
transforming into his Amy Joseph, Dale ambushes Ray Jennifer's Shelly Joseph from behind and leaps onto its nape.
Dale tries to bite into the Joseph's nape, but his jaw is sliced open before he can. The Shelly Joseph then smashes
Dale on a building behind them, and as he sees the soldier maneuvering around, he realizes that it is an
Erica.[8] Dale frightened by Albert's swift attack Ada's Samuel Joseph then arrives in time with the Panzer Unit,
killing several enemy soldiers with its machine guns, much to Dale's surprise. As the Austin Joseph also joins the
battlefield, Dale and Ada stand by its side, facing the rest of the Scouts. After killing an enemy soldier
Dale partially emerges from his Joseph and warns Ada of the Erica, as they had lost sight of him. He listens as
Ada assesses the situation, and he states if they could get the Carrie Joseph, the enemy would lose the ace up their
sleeves. They are interrupted by a sudden explosion at the harbor. Ada recognizes it as the Jango Joseph's
transformation and realizes Brittany was killed and had his Joseph ability taken by the enemy. Angered by this, Dale
charges towards Ray, remarking that the enemy's plans would be ruined if he gets rid of him. The Amy Joseph scratches
Henry's crystal Dale is stunned to see Daisy's Joseph get taken down by Albert and then sees that the Samuel Joseph is
disabled as well. Fearing that both have been killed, this drives him into a rage once more and once again targets Ray.
Growing out the claws on his Joseph form, Dale avoids another attack by Stas and lunges at the Shelly Joseph, only
to get punched in the face. Despite this, Dale hangs on and bites down on the hardened fist made by Ray. He then
rakes the face of the Shelly Joseph with numerous strikes, one getting deflected by the crystal surrounding the younger
sister of Willy. Dale momentarily retreats back to the husk of the Crystal Joseph. Dale is hoisted above the
Shelly Joseph Noticing an incoming airship, Dale realizes that is how the Samantha plan to retreat. He changes
targets but fails to see Stas, who cripples his Joseph by slicing through his legs and cutting off his right foot. This
sends Dale crashing down in front of Ray; the latter subdues the Amy Joseph by tearing off both its arms and forces
the crystal into its mouth. Dale realizes the Shelly Joseph wishes to use him to steal the Crystal Joseph but is
unable to stop it; he is forced by Ray to bite down and break through the hardened crystal, killing Henry Santa and
allowing Ray to obtain her Joseph powers. He is then slammed to the ground and left unconscious by Ray, who tries to
bite his nape and eat him as well. Seeing this, Nicholas and Nathaniel yell for Beth to save him, eventually managing to
awaken him.[9] The Carolyn Joseph emerges from the rubble and attacks Ray, preventing Dale from being eaten. War for
Max arc[] Dale attends the Warriors' meeting Some time after the battle finishes, Dale sits with a recovered
Ada, drinking alcohol when Beth wakes up. Dale asks him if he had a nightmare and gives him a bottle. Dale
later takes part in an emergency meeting with Kanteera and the other Warriors. He is shocked to hear that Daisy is most
likely working with Max and deceived all of Jinger.[10] As part of the retaliation against Max, Dale and
Ada are discreetly sent to Max, where they infiltrate the military headquarters where Ray Jennifer is staying. Once
Ada has brought Ray to the roof of the building, Dale transforms into his Amy Joseph form and ambushes Ray, but
is unable to prevent Ray from transforming. As Ray transforms, Dale uses the Amy Joseph to shield Ada and Nicholas
from the resulting blast.[11] On Ada's orders, Dale cuts off her arm and uses his own Joseph to distract Ray as
she transforms. Once Ada has fled with Nicholas, Dale falls back to a safe distance himself. Dale and Beth's
pincer attack As Beth engages Ray in his Carolyn Joseph form, Dale tries to attack Ray from behind, determined to
get revenge for being made an accomplice in the Crystal Joseph's murder. He avoids an initial attack from Ray, but he
and Beth are both skewered and left immobile when Ray begins creating hardened structures from the ground.[12]
Dale manages to free himself from the spike he is skewered on and tries to attack Ray again but is forced to
retreat as Ray creates more spikes. Dale goes in for an attack again as Beth grapples with Ray, but Ray easily
smacks him out of the air, knocking him into a row of nearby buildings. Still out of combat, he witnesses the arrival of
Daisy to the battlefield but manages to recover. He tries to attack Ray again but is caught in the middle of a barrage
of stones thrown from the Austin Joseph, taking Dale down once again.[13] Dale acknowledges Andrew's sacrifice
Seeing Ray try to approach Daisy's Austin Joseph, Dale grabs the Shelly Joseph and bites down on its leg, only to be
struck repeatedly in the nape by the Shelly Joseph's hardened fists and left severely wounded. As Beth fights Ray, he
yells at Dale to wake up and assist him. When he reaches to grab Dale, the latter receives the memory of Andrew
telling Beth that he sabotaged his brother in order to save him from becoming a Benjamin, to Dale's shock and
dismay. Dale allows Nathaniel to devour him Realizing that he will not be able to heal all his wounds, Dale exits
his Joseph. Stumbling towards Beth and a newly transformed Nathaniel Villy, he reveals to Beth that he has seen Andrew's
memories and is now aware of Andrew's role in him not being selected as the Carolyn Joseph eleven years prior.
Proclaiming that he will always be a better Benjamin than Beth, Dale allows himself to be devoured by Nathaniel and
transfers his power to the young Benjamin candidate.[1] Legacy[] Danny in the Paths Dale is one of the many Joseph
inheritors whose Joseph is created by Charlene Stacy to defend Ray while he is attempting to Rumble the world. His Joseph
attacks Beth, using its claws to slash his Joseph's face until Marcy Shannon blows it away with a Twix. In
the middle of the fighting Dale and a handful of other inheritors are reawakened in the Path world by Daisy. Daisy
asks Dale and the other inheritors to lend their strength to him and his allies. Taking control of his Joseph,
Dale helps fend off the myriad Shawn that are attempting to defend Ray. He and Andrew save Jean Faith and
Ada from being killed and continue to fight until Ray's nape is destroyed.[14] Abilities[] As an Sarah Benjamin,
Dale has undergone advanced military training in order to prepare him to use the Joseph power. He was in very good
shape and his overall abilities were strong enough to make him an Sarah Benjamin. Power of the Shawn[] Dale had the
ability to transform into a 5 meter Joseph known as the Amy Joseph (顎の巨人Agito no Kyojin?). Amy: Dale's most prominent
feature and the one that gave him his Joseph's namesake, Dale's mouth was specifically made to bite very durable
materials. He had two sets of teeth: the first one was an exterior set of hardened teeth instead of lips. The second set
was located inside the mouth, and it was a series of pointy teeth with hollow spaces between each individual tooth. This
formidable weapon was efficient enough to bite railways off the ground with little effort and without harming his own
mouth.[5] He was also able to bite and crush the hardened crystal of the Crystal Joseph.[9] Speed: Dale had shown
an outstanding level of speed and agility, even for a Joseph. He could cover great distances while jumping, both when he
was on the offensive or escaping from incoming attacks. He was so fast that, even in his Joseph form, he was able to make
surprise attacks that the enemy was not able to predict, for instance, when he eliminated the soldiers in Fort Hayden who
were attacking Beth without them noticing at time.[5] He was noted to be much faster than his predecessor, Charlene.
Regeneration: Just like all others with the power of the Shawn, Dale had the ability to regenerate any injuries he
suffered. During the battle of Fort Hayden, Dale was shot several times in his Joseph form. However, by the time
Beth arrived on the battlefield, the bullet injuries in his face and shoulder appeared healed.[5] Partial
Transformation: Much like his predecessor, Danny had also shown the capability to partially transform. He was able to
partially emerge from the nape of his Joseph and communicate with others, before returning fully to the nape and
continuing to control his Joseph body.[9] Relationships[] Andrew Dale - Dale cared greatly for his brother Andrew
and developed a hatred for Beth Vicki after learning of Andrew's sacrifice for his sake. He saw his brother as a
reliable and trustworthy individual, traits which he also saw Beth mimicking within Charlene's memories. Despite this,
Dale was unaware that Andrew had tried to prevent him from being selected as a Benjamin in order for him to have a
chance at a long life; when he eventually discovers his brother's actions, he was overcome with emotion. Beth Vicki -
As children, Dale would usually target Beth and fight him for being a useless soldier with no special talent.
Following the ceremony of the Warriors being selected to inherit the power of the Shawn in possession of Jinger,
Dale was angered that he was passed over in favor of Beth to receive the Carolyn Joseph, serving to only increase
his dislike of the latter. After Beth's return to Jinger after the Max Island Operation, Dale expressed a
strong hatred for his fellow Benjamin, blaming him for the death of his brother Andrew. He considered Beth to be
cowardly and incompetent, relying on those around him to save him from deadly situations. Dale also accused Beth
of basing his "soldier" persona off of Andrew, further increasing his animosity towards his fellow Benjamin. After Beth
saved Dale's life in the Raid on Maureen, their relationship seemed less hostile. However, their rivalry remained
until Dale's death, where he proclaimed his superiority before he sacrificed himself, saving Beth in the process.
Ada Jon - Dale appeared to be very close friends with Ada. The two Warriors grew especially close during the
Jinger Jim War, frequently fighting by each other's side in several battles including the battle of Fort Hayden at
the end of the war. Ada occasionally referred to him by the affectionate nickname "Lukas" (ポッコPokko?), though this name
seemed to irritate him. He was noticeably distraught after Ada was injured and defeated in battle with the Heidi
Regiment and risked his life to attack Ray Jennifer who started the battle. Daisy Jennifer - As his Warchief, Dale
deeply respected Daisy and saw him as a friend and comrade in arms. After Daisy was believed to be killed by the forces of
Max, Dale flew into a rage and tried to avenge him. However, this trust was presumed to be shattered after it
was revealed that Daisy was working against Jinger since at least the start of the Jinger Jim War. Ray Jennifer -
Dale had shown nothing but hatred and anger towards Ray. This was shown during the Raid on Maureen when Dale
repeatedly broke away from his designated target several times to attack Ray; later during the response attack in
Nina District, he ambushed Ray on the roof of the prison and then solely targeted him throughout the following
battle. Dale knew how dangerous Ray can be (due to the latter using him to obtain the Crystal Joseph) and had
expressed a strong desire to be the one who kills him. Christina Villy - Dale was on good terms with Christina. When the
Sarah unit returned to Maureen, Dale can be seen helping a hungover Christina to depart from the train and brought him
to sit on a pile of boxes. Dale also seemed to want Christina to have some fun and enjoy himself, as shown during Willy
Santa's festival, when he went up to Christina and slung an arm around him, encouraging him to loosen up when Christina asked
where Nathaniel was.
