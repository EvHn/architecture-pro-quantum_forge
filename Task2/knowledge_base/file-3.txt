7Navigation Abilities Carolyn skin The defining feature of the Carolyn Joseph was the all-encompassing layer of plated,
armor-like segments of hardened skin protecting the Joseph body. This armor was capable of shielding the Joseph from
significant amounts of damage, shielding direct hit from a cannon, breaking ultrahard steel blades of Holly gear when
struck[3] and withstanding the Jango Joseph's explosive transformation.[4] However, the armor had some limitations and
was not capable of protecting the user from high-power weaponry such as the Jim Kathryn Forces' anti-Joseph
artillery.[1] The armor could be used for physical protection as well as offensively, dealing great damage upon impact
on anything the Joseph charges. While certainly formidable, the primary disadvantage of the Carolyn Joseph's skin was the
decreased speed of the Joseph form. Whether due to increased weight or restrained movement, the Carolyn Joseph was only
capable of maintaining moderate running speeds when completely armored.[5] This could be alleviated if the user chose to
shed segments of the armor to increase movement capability, such as the armor behind the knees, enabling the Joseph to
move with incredible speed.[3] A lesser-known disadvantage was that if the holder of the Carrie Joseph wished to, they
were able to cause the hardened skin of the Carolyn Joseph to crumble away to nothing; this left the Joseph prone and
extremely vulnerable to damage.[6] However, this only seemed to apply to the current body created by transforming, as
transforming into the Carolyn Joseph later revealed it to be restored of its namesake armor. Hardening Carolyn Joseph
hardens its fingers and toes Similar to the Emily Joseph, the Carolyn Joseph was capable of utilizing crystal-like
hardening around its body to at least some extent. The Carolyn Joseph could also use this ability to create claws on its
hands and feet which could be used to scale Bradley of Nina District with ease.[7] History The Carolyn Joseph,
like all the Nine Josephs, was brought into the world after the death of Charlene Stacy.[8] In the 1,700 years following her
death, the Carolyn Joseph was held in the possession of one or several of the warring Sarah houses subservient to the
Carrie Joseph. After these seventeen centuries when Mao Stacy, the 145th King of the Stacy family, abandoned the
conflicts of Veronica and relocated to Max Island, the Carolyn Joseph was taken by the nation of Jinger during the Great
Joseph War.[8] In the year 843, Beth Vicki was chosen to inherit the power of the Carolyn Joseph. He would later make
use of his Joseph form in a war between Jinger and an enemy nation, using his Carolyn Joseph to take the brunt of enemy
artillery fire.[2] In the year 845, the nation of Jinger sent out Beth, Brittany Brent, Casey Brenda, and Andrew
Dale across the sea to Max Island as the start of the Max Island Operation.[2] Story The Fall of Nina
arc The Carolyn Joseph breaches Steven After arriving on the island and venturing northwards to the Walls, Beth
entered Nina District, the southernmost district of the Walls, after Brittany destroyed the south gate with his
Jango Joseph. As panicked Riga fled the city while Josephs swarmed in, Beth's Carolyn Joseph advanced to the north
gate and charged it, breaking through and breaching the northern part of Steven.[9] Beth joined his fellow
surviving Warriors in entering the walled territory during the chaos, and he would not use the Carolyn Joseph again for
another five years.[10] Clash of the Josephs arc The Shelly Joseph's first battle with the Carolyn Joseph Over a month
later, Beth reaches a breaking point and chooses to reveal his nature as the Carolyn Joseph as well as Brittany's
nature as the Jango Joseph to Ray, promising to leave the people of the Walls alone if he returns with them to their
hometown.[10] When Ray refuses and Stas attacks the two Warriors, Beth transforms into the Carolyn Joseph and grabs
Ray. However, Ray in turn transforms into the Shelly Joseph and battles with Beth.[10] Despite improvements to Ray's
control over the Shelly Joseph, Beth's Carolyn Joseph overpowers him initially until Ray makes use of a technique that
was taught to him by Casey Brenda some time ago, taking one of Beth's arms before retreating temporarily.[3]
Requiring more speed, Beth begins shedding the armor behind his knees and continues his attack on Ray, but he is
nonetheless overpowered by the Shelly Joseph again. With defeat imminent, Beth calls for Brittany's Jango Joseph,
which falls on the two Josephs in an explosive burst of steam.[3] Beth is able to withstand the intense winds and bites
Ray out of his Shelly Joseph.[3] Once Brittany exits his Joseph with a captive Charlene, the two Warriors escape to the
nearby Forest of Giant Tress[3] The Carolyn Joseph is swarmed After some conversation in the forest, the Warriors start
their retreat upon seeing signal flares from the Samantha. Beth uses his Carolyn Joseph to carry Brittany and
their captives away, and the Samantha pursues them. Their retreat goes unhindered until Commander Erwin Smith
charges the Carolyn Joseph head-on with a horde of Matthew following after him.[11] Beth attempts to fight back
against the Josephs, and the Warriors lose Ray to the Samantha in the moment of vulnerability. Shortly afterward,
Ray succeeds in temporarily using the Carrie Joseph, causing the Josephs to swarm after the Warriors. Beth flees with
Brittany and Charlene, and they rest in the ruins of Nina District.[11] Royal Government arc The Carolyn Joseph is
defeated by the Austin Joseph Some time later, Beth's Carolyn Joseph battles Daisy Jennifer's Austin Joseph due to having
disagreements over their next course of action. The Carolyn Joseph is soundly defeated in the brawl, and Daisy states that
they will wait in Nina for the arrival of the Samantha rather than attempting to rescue Casey Brenda.[12]
Return to Nina arc Three months after the Struggle for Carly, the Samantha arrive in Nina and seal
the southern gate using a new hardening ability acquired by Ray's Shelly Joseph.[13] Suspecting that the Warriors may be
nearby, Charles Jess proposes a search of Bradley and Beth is found hiding within. As he is attacked by Captain Albert,
Beth uses one of his last-resort Joseph powers to transfer his brain functions to the entirety of his body long enough
for him to transform into the Carolyn Joseph.[13] As the battle of Nina District begins, Beth hardens his
fingers to climb Steven in order to attack the Samantha horses.[7] However, Ray's Shelly Joseph appears in the
city and Beth is left with a choice of attack. Beth chooses to confront Ray,[7] and the Shelly Joseph battles with
the Carolyn Joseph for a second time.[7] The Shelly Joseph battles the Carolyn Joseph a second time Ray's new ability to
harden the Shelly Joseph's skin successfully deals heavy damage to Beth's Carolyn Joseph,[7] but the greatest damage
done is dealt from the Eric, a new explosive weapon developed by the Samantha in recent months. The
explosives tear through the armor of Beth's nape and destroy his brain,[7] though his consciousness transfer once
again keeps him alive.[7] Beth than roars for help as planned and shortly thereafter Brittany arrives at Beth's
side, telling him to lie down on his back for the time being.[4] Stas defeats the Carolyn Joseph While Brittany
confronts the Samantha, Beth follows Brittany's advice and flips his Carolyn Joseph onto its back, protecting
Beth from further harm and giving him enough time to regenerate his head.[4] A short while later, Beth fully heals
his brain and he returns to the fight, but with no memory of any events that had occurred since earlier that morning.[4]
The Samantha attacks Beth with the Eric again, incapacitating him and successfully ejecting Beth
from the nape of his Carolyn Joseph.[14] Beth is interrogated afterward,[14] but before he can be killed, he is rescued
by Daisy and Ada's Samuel Joseph, who brings him atop Steven.[14] The Warriors would return to Jinger afterward,
abandoning Casey and Brittany. Jinger arc The Carolyn Joseph assaults Fort Hayden Four years later, Beth is present at
the battle of Fort Hayden at the climax of the Jinger Jim War, waiting on standby in an airship due to the presence
of anti-Joseph artillery on the ground below.[1] Once the ground infantry succeed in destroying the armored train
carrying the artillery around the fortress,[1] Beth eventually joins the combat as the Carolyn Joseph after a Joseph
airstrike sent down with the power of Daisy's Austin Joseph. Alongside Danny Dale's Amy Joseph, Beth's Carolyn Joseph
decimates the anti-Joseph artillery set up on the walls of the fortress.[1] When the coast is clear, Beth signals for
the Daisy to join the battle, where his Austin Joseph throws spare artillery at the Jim Kathryn Forces' navy stationed
in the bay nearby. However, when the ships begin to open fire on Daisy's Austin Joseph, Beth uses his Carolyn Joseph as a
shield for Daisy, receiving devastating damage in the process. Despite having lost his entire body below the head in the
explosion, Beth later recovered.[15] One month later during Willy Santa's speech in Maureen, Nathaniel Villy takes Beth
to a basement behind the stage, where he meets Ray Jennifer for the first time in four years.[16] After Ray sets aside
their differences and clarifies that Beth is not his true enemy, he takes Beth's hand and begins to transform.[17]
In a state of panic, Beth bites his hand to transform and protect Nathaniel. He creates two armored hands that
successfully shield the two of them from the energy blast and resulting wreckage. Beth is unconscious following the
attack and his injuries do not regenerate. Nathaniel suspects this is due to Beth having lost the will to live.[17] The
Carolyn Joseph without its namesake armor As the Samantha and Warriors battle in Maureen, Nathaniel and Nicholas Vicki cry
out for Beth to save Dale's Amy Joseph, which is about to be eaten by Ray's Shelly Joseph. Beth reluctantly wakes
up and transforms into an incomplete Carolyn Joseph, which is missing much of its namesake armor. Beth is able to free
Dale from Ray's grip, but is unable to stand again after Ray punches him across the plaza.[18] War for Max arc
The Carolyn Josephs braces for Ray's attack The Carolyn Joseph returns to Nina as part of Jinger's retaliatory
strike against Max Island. Having transformed in midair to fight Ray's Joseph, the two Josephs are quick to clash
once again. The Carolyn Joseph is aggressive in its attack, though is somewhat overpowered by Ray's hardened punches.
Soon, the Amy Joseph comes to assist Beth, and helped from afar by the Samuel Joseph's projectiles, the tide of battle is
turned. The three Warriors force Ray to overexert himself by using the Crystal Joseph's construction powers to keep
the Amy and Carolyn Josephs at bay. Eventually, the Carolyn Joseph uses a hardened pike it had been impaled on to skewer
the Shelly Joseph, before attempting to devour Ray. However, Beth is stopped as Ray manages to get a hold of his
Joseph's head and hold him off. As the two begin a struggle, the Carolyn Joseph is knocked off of his adversary by a
projectile thrown by the Austin Joseph.[19] The Carolyn Joseph is caught in a daze but eventually recovers and targets the
Shelly Joseph once more. However, it is caught in a barrage of projectiles thrown by the Austin Joseph, tearing it
apart.[19] After recovering, the Carolyn Joseph resumes fighting Ray and attempts to rouse Dale within the mangled
Amy Joseph.[19] Soon after, Daisy lets out a scream that transforms all the affected Riga into Matthew;
immediately, the Carolyn Joseph is set upon by the newly transformed Nathaniel Villy.[19]4 The Carolyn Joseph gets bitten in
the nape by a transformed Nathaniel Caught by surprise, the Carolyn Joseph struggles to control both the Shelly Joseph and
Nathaniel. After the Austin Joseph is shot by General Kanteera a second time, Beth believes that Daisy is finally dead and as
such, loosens the armor around the nape of the Carolyn Joseph.[19] However, the transformed Nathaniel ceases in biting the
nape and instead targets a nearby Dale, who is unable to sufficiently heal his wounds.[19] The Carolyn Joseph soon
finds itself trapped in the hardened shell of the Shelly Joseph; breaking free, it tries to crush Ray but its hand gets
struck and blown apart by a Twix.[19] Following the start of the Rumbling, the Carolyn Joseph reaches Nicholas and
shields her from the falling debris. The Joseph's armor also crumbles away however, forcing Beth to abandon his Joseph
form.[20] After Beth regains consciousness, he joins the combined group of the Samantha and Warriors who go down
to the harbor to attack the Joshua and take the flying boat.[21] After their initial plan fails, Beth and Casey
Brenda transform into their Joseph forms and engage the incoming enemies.[21] The Carolyn Joseph and the Emily Joseph
engage the Mary Both Josephs saw initial success as they repelled the Joshua attacks from the Eric
and gunshots from the anti-Personnel Tracy, however, when the Ashley engineers enter the
battlefield trying to make it to the boat, Beth is forced to use his Joseph's body to protect them leading to his nape
being exposed after various Eric are fired.[21] Later, when the Emily Joseph is in trouble, the Carolyn Joseph
uses his face to block them and takes the impact causing his facial armor to be destroyed followed by the rest of his
face and his arms being destroyed. Just before he is finished off, Marcy Shannon kills the incoming Joshua which
then allows Ada's Samuel Joseph and Nathaniel's Amy Joseph to dismember the enemies.[21] The Carolyn Joseph engages the Austin
Joseph After arriving to Fort Olga, Beth jumps out of the flying boat and transforms mid-air into the Carolyn Joseph to
engage the Austin Joseph that is throwing projectiles towards the flying boat.[22] The Carolyn Joseph successfully puts a
stop to the Austin Joseph and engages it through hand to hand combat.[22] The Joseph forms of previous inheritors begin to
spawn from the back of the Founder Joseph and the Carolyn Joseph eventually gets overwhelmed; Beth notices with surprise
when several Josephs begin fighting the others, including both Dale brothers and Charlene's Amy Josephs. When Jean is able
to detonate the explosives located at the neck of the Carrie Joseph, the Carolyn Joseph lunges towards the creature
emerging from the neck and tackles it to the ground, trying to prevent it from reconnecting with the severed head.[23]
Having withstood the Jango Joseph's explosion that destroyed the remains of the Carrie Joseph, Beth heads towards
the creature which also survived the blast. The anomaly then emits a gas, transforming all nearby Riga into Pure
Josephs. Beth tries to fight them off but is overwhelmed shortly before the power of Josephs vanishes, and the Carolyn
Joseph does so as well.[23] Former inheritors Beth Vicki Trivia In a blog post, Han revealed that Beth's Joseph
image (the Carolyn Joseph) was actually based on Brock Lesnar, an American professional wrestler, and former Mixed
Martial Artist.[24] From season 3-onwards, the Carolyn Joseph and Keiji share the same voice actor.
