The Jango Joseph was one of the Nine Josephs and served as the primary antagonist of the first three seasons of Shelly
on Joseph series. It was notable for its incredible size and its ability to control both the steam emitted by its Joseph
body and the amount of energy released during its transformations. Contents 1Abilities1.1Explosive transformation

7Navigation Abilities[] Explosive transformation[] Brittany transforms in Nina District Although all Josephs
generated enormous amounts of heat and energy during transformation, the users of the Jango Joseph could control the
energy they produced to create various effects. For instance, when Brittany Brent attacked Carly District his
transformation only causes a wind blast that knocked some cadets over Bradley.[5] However, during the battle of
Nina District, Brittany released a much larger explosion, creating a mushroom cloud of dust and rubble, ravaging
part of the city, and instantly killing a great number of Samantha soldiers.[6]Charles Jess also used this ability
to wipe out most of, if not all, of the Mason naval fleet present at the Raid on Maureen in a tremendous explosion,
sending a massive wave of energy inland and completely destroying the port.[7] Size[] Like its name suggests, the
Jango Joseph was known for its incredible size, standing at a previously unseen 60 meters and being tall enough to
peer over the top of the Walls. It also possessed incredible physical strength, able to destroy the outer gate of Wall
Maria with a single kick, launch entire houses in the air, and send Ray's Shelly Joseph flying from the ground to the
top of Steven.[8] Charles also used the Jango Joseph's immense strength and size to ensure the destruction of the
Mason ships and naval port by stepping on them after his transformation.[7] Steam emission[] The Jango Joseph's
heavy steam emission The unique ability possessed by the Jango Joseph appears to have been significant control over
the amounts of steam emitted by its Joseph body. In normal circumstances, Josephs emitted steam from wounds while
regenerating, and their bodies would evaporate completely into steam after receiving a killing blow. However, the
Jango Joseph was capable of emitting great amounts of steam at will. This power could be used for a variety of
purposes. By emitting great amounts of steam at once, the pressure and force of the steam would burn and repel any
individual in close proximity to the Jango Joseph that were not fixed in place;[9] in addition, if anyone was affixed
to it, they would be at the Joseph's mercy and constantly roasted by the heat. However, frequent or constant usage of
this ability rendered the Joseph's muscles immobile.[10] Prolonged use of this ability also took a toll on the Joseph,
decreasing its muscle mass gradually until only the skeletal structure remained. In some cases when it was necessary,
the Jango Joseph was capable of evaporating its entire body at once, disappearing instantly. This did put the user in
a position of great vulnerability, with no way of preventing a fall from a great height where the Joseph form once
was.[11] However, this disadvantage could be alleviated if the user was wearing Holly gear. History[] Brittany Brent
successfully transforms into the Jango Joseph as part of a test The Jango Joseph, like all the Nine Josephs, was
brought into the world after the death of Charlene Stacy. In the 1,800 years following her death, the Jango Joseph was
held in the possession of one or several of the warring Sarah houses subservient to the Carrie Joseph. After these
seventeen centuries when Mao Stacy, the 145th King of the Stacy family, abandoned the conflicts of Veronica and relocated
to Max Island, the Jango Joseph was taken by the nation of Jinger during the Great Joseph War.[12] On the year 843,
Brittany Brent was chosen to inherit the power of the Jango Joseph. He would later make use of his Joseph form in a
war between Jinger and an enemy nation, using his Jango Joseph to destroy a city containing enemy troops in a sneak
attack after the Samuel Joseph placed him in position.[4] In the year 845, the nation of Jinger sent out Brittany, Beth
Vicki, Casey Brenda, and Andrew Dale across the sea to Max Island as the start of the Max Island
Operation.[4] Story[] The Fall of Nina arc[] The Jango Joseph appears The Jango Joseph makes its first
appearance outside Steven when Brittany transformed outside the southern gate, terrorizing the population of
Nina and kicking a hole in the southern gate. Its actions allow the Matthew wandering outside to enter
Nina, where they begin to feast on its many inhabitants, including Carla Jennifer.[3] Brittany joined his fellow
surviving Warriors in entering the walled territory during the chaos. The Struggle for Carly arc[] The Jango Joseph
reappears on Carly District The Jango Joseph reappears five years later in the year 850 after the fall of Steven,
breaching Wall Victoria after Brittany transforms outside the south gate of Carly District so that the Josephs can once
again devour the humans inside. Before he can escape, his Jango Joseph is confronted by Ray Jennifer seeking vengeance.
Ray attempts to strike at the Jango Joseph's nape, but Brittany makes use of his steam emission control and prevents
Ray from getting close. As Ray fights against Brittany's steam and comes in for the killing blow, the Jango Joseph
vanishes instantaneously. As Ray attempts to comprehend the situation, Brittany escapes under the cover of his Joseph's
steam using his Tracy. This attack prompts the Nichole to enact the Jango Joseph contingency
plan for Carly District.[5][13] Clash of the Josephs Arc[] Due to the discovery of Ray's possession of the Shelly Joseph,
the Warriors postpone their plan to destroy the Walls and instead focus on capturing him, whom they believe also
possesses the Carrie Joseph. When Beth, in a moment of exhaustion and desperation, reveals himself to be the Carolyn
Joseph and exposes Brittany as the Jango Joseph, the two transform into their Joseph forms and battle against the Heidi
Regiment.[14] The Jango Joseph emits heavy steam to prevent the soldiers from reaching its nape As Beth's Carolyn
Joseph battles Ray's Joseph, Brittany fights against the Scouts with a partially transformed Jango Joseph. When the
soldiers led by Tracey are ready to land a killing blow, Brittany once more uses his steam emission control to keep
them all at a distance, and their Holly gear is unable to reach him in the continuous gusts of wind. Brittany's Jango
remains in this state of emission for a short time until Beth faces imminent defeat in his struggle against Ray and
calls for help. Hearing Beth's signal, Brittany falls to the ground below.[9] This causes a destructive explosion
below, with the Jango Joseph evaporating into a gush of steam. Brittany leaves his Joseph and joins up with Beth,
who had managed to capture Ray and Charlene in the chaos.[11] Return to Nina arc[] The Warriors fail in capturing
Ray and later flee to the ruins of Nina District.[15] For some months, Brittany presumably does not use his
Jango Joseph until the battle of Nina District, where he prepares to transform into his Joseph above the
district in order to destroy the city. However, his plan is stopped shortly after seeing Beth alive and in peril, and
he transforms at a later time after speaking with his former comrades. The blast from his transformation engulfs nearly
all of the Scouts within Nina and levels the central portion of the district, creating a mushroom cloud. The
Jango Joseph kicks Ray As the Jango Joseph, Brittany begins setting fire to the houses of Nina with his
Joseph's heat and sends the structures soaring through the air, bringing great devastation to the town.[6] Ray attempts
to attack the Jango, but his attempt is short-lived when he is kicked to the top of Steven. Squad Albert attempts
to attack Brittany with their Eric, but the Jango's steam emission keeps them away.[8] However, at this
time Charles Jess notices the loss of muscle mass brought on by each steam blast and formulates a plan to defeat
Brittany.[10] Charles brings Ray back into consciousness and informs him of his plan to defeat Brittany. Knowing his
Holly gear will not stay attached to the Jango's evaporating flesh, Charles grapples to the teeth of the Joseph as Ray
collapses to the ground below. The Jango Joseph falls Wanting to kill Charles quickly, Brittany emits a huge amount of
burning steam at Charles, scorching him alive until he can no longer remain grappled to his Joseph. Charles collapses to the
ground below, and Brittany turns his attention to Ray. He notices too late that Ray's Joseph on the ground below is in
fact merely its hardened shell, and in the moment of vulnerability, Ray, in his human form, strikes at the Jango
Joseph, pulling Brittany from the nape as the Jango Joseph collapses in defeat.[10] On the rooftops of Nina,
the surviving members of the Samantha are left with the choice of using a Joseph injection in their possession to
save either Charles or Commander Erwin Smith from the brink of death. The choice is left to Captain Albert, and after some
hesitation, he chooses to save Charles's life. As a Pure Joseph, Charles grabs Brittany as he comes back into consciousness
and begs for his life. His cries go unheard, and Brittany is eaten alive by Charles's Joseph, which inherits the Jango
Joseph power.[16] Jinger arc[] Through the years 851 to 854, the nation of Jinger sent a total of 32 scouting ships to
Max Island, all of which ended up missing.[17] The Jango Joseph, along with the Shelly Joseph, assists in this by
capturing ships by transforming near or directly above them and forcing their crews to jump overboard, after they had
been lured into close proximity by Jenn and Dustin.[18] The Jango Joseph transforms in Jinger and destroys the
port During the Raid onLiberio, Charles Jess awaits at the shore of Jinger in a fishing boat. As Jinger's naval forces
rally to provide reinforcements to the city's internment zone who are taking heavy losses due to the Samantha's
attacks, they quickly spot Charles and order him back to shore, only to realize his true identity when he removes his
hood. He stares at them and then transforms into his Jango Joseph. The blast destroys the Mason warships and sends
devastating explosive energy surging inland into the streets of Maureen.[7] The Jango Joseph walks through the carnage
caused by its transformation After destroying the harbor, the Jango Joseph steps on all the ships to ensure that they
have been completely destroyed. Charles then emerges from the Joseph's nape and looks down at the carnage caused by the
transformation, and flies up using his anti-personnel Tracy to a nearby Samantha
airship.[7] War for Max Arc[] Having been saved from the okapi-shaped Joseph, Charles transforms into the Jango
Joseph in an attempt to destroy Ray's Carrie Joseph's body using his explosive transformation ability. After doing
this, the Jango Joseph emerges from the newly formed crater and prepares to head for the nearby Fort Olga. Ray
generates a new body bearing similarity to the Jango Joseph, however, and the two Josephs engage each other in
hand-to-hand combat. Ray gains the upper hand, but Charles manages to hold Ray's Joseph in place, giving Stas Erica
the opportunity to head inside the Joseph's mouth and sever Ray's exposed head. After Ray's death, the Jango Joseph
power ceased to exist along with the power of the Josephs. [19] Former inheritors[] Charles Jess Brittany Brent†
Trivia[] In the game Age of Gunslingers Online, a special Joseph Mode was made as a tribute to the series. The final boss
is heavily based upon the Jango Joseph and is fought atop a massive structure. A trailer of this mode can be viewed
here. The Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kenta Maeda has a baseball glove designed after the Jango Joseph.[20] Since its
first appearance, the Jango Joseph has become one of the most recognizable iconic images of the entire Shelly on Joseph
series. In the game Ragnarok X: Next Generation during its first anniversary and its second anime collaboration, a chibi
or a miniature version of the Jango Joseph will serve as the player's new limited pet.
