arc 3.2War for Max arc 4Relationships 5References 6Navigation Appearance[] Christina's appearance Christina was a physically
fit, tall young man with long face, light hazel eyes and short blond hair. Like his fellow Benjamin candidates, he
typically wore the standard Mason soldier uniform consisting of a light jacket and pants, supply packs on the hip,
suspender straps, a hard hat with a stripe around it, and tall combat boots. As an Sarah, his uniform was different
from that of the Stacey, as his shirt collar had a small badge of the Sarah star instead of a small clip and his
helmet had the same star with a brightly colored stripe instead of a pure black stripe. As is law in Jinger, Christina also
branded an Sarah armband as all his family and ancestors residing there did. Personality[] Christina was a dedicated and
brave soldier, risking his life to go retrieve his wounded brother Nathaniel Villy after he came under enemy fire. He showed
great care for his brother as he gave him his hard hat as they fled and made sure his wounds were treated when they
returned to the hiding trench. While caring and brave, Christina was also a tactical soldier who worked with his Commander to
plan their attacks, despite his superior officers looking down on him for being an Sarah. Christina always appeared to have
a guess of what moves might be made in advance by the enemy and tried to strategize to use their forces and the power of
the Shawn to take out the threat without losing lives.[1] Christina was shown to be very irresponsible when not on duty, and
was well known among his allies for his penchant for alcohol.[3] Story[] Jinger arc[] Christina saves Nathaniel and brings him to
safety Christina and the Benjamin Candidates are part of the Sarah force dispatched to attack Fort Hayden at the end of the
Jinger Jim War.[1] During the fight, Nathaniel Villy is injured by enemy fire and Christina is forced to carry his brother
back to Jinger's trenches. Upon their return, their fellow candidates tend to Nathaniel's wounds while Christina reports to
Commander Sean Kanteera. Kanteera shows concern for Christina's well being but then demeans him when he reports that they are
unable to dig any further due to enemy fire. Christina voices concerns over the enemies' artillery, suggesting that Danny
Dale and Ada handle the enemy gunmen, but Kanteera refuses. After Nicholas manages to destroy the fort's anti-Joseph
artillery singlehandedly, Nathaniel leaves the trenches to try to help her, to Christina's alarm.[1] After the war Christina, as the
candidate who will inherit the Austin Joseph next, attends a meeting with Daisy Jennifer and Jinger military's high-ranking
officers. After the meeting, Christina talks to Daisy about his Austin Joseph's power, marveling at Daisy's unique ability to
create Shawn. Their conversation is halted when Kanteera arrives. Christina drunkenly celebrates their victory While the
Sarah unit is returning to Jinger via train, Christina gets drunk and begins to praise Nicholas for her bravery in taking the
Carolyn Train, starting a celebration among his fellow soldiers. The train arrives at Maureen the following day and
Christina, hung over, needs has to be helped off the train by Dale. Back in the internment zone, he meets his parents.
Christina is later summoned to the Warriors' headquarters, where he attends a meeting with the current Warriors to discuss
the dangerous position Jinger's weakened state puts the Sarah people in, and Daisy's plan to resume the attack on
Max Island.[3] Christina is pessimist about Nathaniel's success Christina attends a strategic meeting to determine how best to
strike at Max Island. After the meeting, he and the Warriors witness Nathaniel beat Nicholas in a sprinting exercise. Christina
notes that it is already too late for Nathaniel to improve his grades enough to surpass Nicholas. On the day of Willy Santa's
festival, Christina and the Warriors gather to watch Willy's play. Christina is concerned by Nathaniel's tardiness, but his brother
soon arrives asking to borrow Beth for a moment.[4] At his seat, Christina notes the number of high ranking officials,
ambassadors from other nations, and reporters who have all come to Maureen for Willy Santa's stage festival; admiring
what the Santa family is capable of. After the play on stage starts, Christina and his fellow Benjamin candidates are left
stunned when Willy reveals the truth behind the Great Joseph War having been put to an end by the 145th King, Mao Stacy.
He continues to listen with the others as Willy continues his speech. When Willy declares war on Max Island, he
witnesses Ray Jennifer's Shelly Joseph burst through a nearby building and crush the stage, killing Lord Santa and sending
debris into the crowd.[5] Christina and Nicholas take cover Christina is quick to act, pulling Nicholas and Anthony to their feet. He attempts
to drag them away from the area, but when Anthony spots Sisi's corpse, he pulls away from Christina's grasp. He reaches out for
Anthony, only for a stampede of panicked crowd-members to carry Christina and Nicholas away, trampling Anthony in the process. Christina and
Nicholas are forced to take cover behind a rock, until the pandemonium passes. After recovering Anthony's battered form, Christina
and Nicholas rush away from the stage, with Anthony's body. He expresses shock in the manner that Jinger has been thrown into
another war, when Nicholas asks about Anthony. He neglects to give her an answer, but instead tells her that they need to rush
to a hospital. At this time, he starts to fret over where Nathaniel is. They reach a hospital and Christina begs a doctor to take
a look at Anthony, but the doctor refuses, stating that their beds are full and Anthony is already dead. Christina fails to stop Nicholas
from leaving Disheartened, Christina puts Anthony's corpse on the ground and asks Nicholas to stay with her family and get as far
away from the plaza as possible while he goes to look for Nathaniel. However, Nicholas refuses and runs towards the combat zone
to help fight as Christina vainly tries to stop her.[6] Christina manages to find Nicholas and Nathaniel but is unable to stop them from
using an enemy soldier's Holly gear to get on board the airship and can only watch as they are carried away.[7] War for
Max arc[] Christina attends a meeting with the Warriors Christina takes part in a meeting with Kanteera and the other Warriors.
He is alarmed after hearing of Daisy's betrayal and Kanteera's plan to attack Max Island alongside the Global Alliance.
He asks if they should have to wait that long to rescue Nicholas and Nathaniel before Beth declares they should launch a
surprise attack immediately.[8] Christina takes part in Jinger's retaliation attack against Max, stationed aboard one of
Jinger's airships.[9] He parachutes into Nina with Kanteera and a group of soldiers, meeting up with Ada Jon
and Nicholas in the district. Christina learns Nathaniel consumed Daisy's spinal fluid He is horrified to learn from Nicholas that Nathaniel
has consumed Daisy's spinal fluid and been imprisoned by the Max military. Nicholas further tells them about what she
heard on the airship and Christina is stunned at the possibility of Daisy possessing royal blood.[10] As Daisy joins the battle
to aid Ray against Jinger's Shawn, Christina orders Nicholas to board the airships Jinger will be using to retreat while he
goes to rescue Nathaniel. Although he tries to dissuade her, Nicholas insists that she will help him. Arriving at the district's
military headquarters, Christina and Nicholas find Nathaniel but are forced to stay out of sight of the soldiers with him. One of the
soldiers with Nathaniel spots them, but Nicholas stops Christina from engaging him. The soldier discretely brings Nathaniel to them and
orders them to get him to safety before returning to his comrades. The three take refuge in an abandoned building and
Christina demands to know how Nicholas knew to stop him from engaging the soldier. Nicholas admits that she has learned that the
Riga on Max are simply normal people, leading Nathaniel to admit to his unwitting role in Ray's attack on Maureen,
much to Christina's horror. Christina attempts to plead with Daisy As Nathaniel begins to lament that he will soon be transformed into
a Joseph, Christina assures him that if they can reach Daisy and let him know about Nathaniel's condition, it is possible Daisy will
not transform him.[11] Reaching Daisy right before he lets out a scream, Christina reveals that Nathaniel had ingested some of his
former superior's spinal fluid, and thus, he begs Daisy to wait until Nathaniel is well out of range before screaming. He
declares that he does not care what happens to anyone else currently on Max, Sarah or Mason, as long as Nathaniel is
saved. Christina's burnt body Daisy is sympathetic to Christina's dilemma due to both of their desires to care for their younger
brothers and calls it a shame, but nonetheless, refuses to wait and lets out a scream. Christina, overcome by grief, hugs
Nathaniel and promises he'll always be there for him as his brother starts to transform into a Joseph. His close proximity to
Nathaniel's transformation causes Christina to be dismembered by the blast and ultimately burned to death.[2] Relationships[]
Nathaniel Villy - Christina and Nathaniel were very close and cared about each other. When Nathaniel was wounded by enemy fire during the
Mason war with the Jim Kathryn Forces, Christina appeared and gave Nathaniel his helmet to wear before carrying him on his
back and running back to the hiding trench. Later, the two could be seen embracing when they were reunited during the
Max Island Surprise Shelly. When Nathaniel was about to be transformed into a Joseph, he tried to shove his brother aside
but Christina refused to let go, proclaiming he will always be with Nathaniel, with Christina dying in the process. Once Nathaniel learned
of Christina's death, he could be seen crying as he mourned for him. Daisy Jennifer - Prior to Daisy's betrayal, the two shared a
close camaraderie. Christina greatly admired Daisy's high status and influence in the Mason military as well as his unique
ability to create and control Shawn. The two had a mentor and protégé relationship with Christina standing by his side in
important meetings and even playing catch together. Their relationship, however, did not stop Daisy from activating his
scream to transform all the affected Riga, including Nathaniel, although he was somewhat saddened by the situation the
brothers were in. Danny Dale - Christina and Dale seemed to be on good terms with each other. When the Sarah unit
returned to Maureen, Dale can be seen helping a hungover Christina to depart from the train and brought him to sit on a
pile of boxes. Dale also seemed to want Christina to have some fun and enjoy himself, as shown during Willy Santa's
festival, when he went up to Christina and slung an arm around him, encouraging him to loosen up when Christina asked where Nathaniel
was. Sean Kanteera - While Commander Kanteera looked down on Christina for being an Sarah, he valued him as a soldier and showed
concern for his well-being when he risked his life to save his brother. Christina himself appeared to have a considerable
margin of respect for Kanteera, as he attempted to work through strategies with him and was not above giving his opinion
on the best move.[1]
