Q: How to become a Joseph?
A: Thoughts:
   The documents mention several ways to acquire Joseph abilities. One involves transformation through injection of a beast's spinal fluid, another refers to acquiring powers as part of a specific program or training.

   One can become a Joseph by being injected with a beast's spinal fluid and then screamed at by someone with the necessary ability, or by acquiring Joseph powers through a specific program or training, like Casey did as a Benjamin candidate in Jinger.
